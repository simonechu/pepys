		</h1>

		

		<p>All the morning very busy at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> preparing a last half-year&#8217;s account for my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a>. At noon eat a bit and stepped to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke</a>, by coach to my Lord Treasurer&#8217;s, and after some private conference and examining of my papers with him I did return into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, whom I found with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12332/">Commissioners of Prizes</a> dining at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke&#8217;s</a>, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1024/">Broad Streete</a>, very merry. Among other tricks, there did come a blind fiddler to the doore, and Sir G. Carteret did go to the doore and lead the blind fiddler by the hand in. Thence with Sir G. Carteret to my Lord Treasurer, and by and by come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, and anon we come to my Lord, and there did lay open the expence for the six months past, and an estimate of the seven months to come, to November next: the first arising to above 500,000<i>l.</i>, and the latter will, as we judge, come to above 1,000,000<i>l.</i>.</p>

<p>But to see how my Lord Treasurer did bless himself, crying he could do no more than he could, nor give more money than he had, if the occasion and expence were never so great, which is but a sad story. And then to hear how like a passionate and ignorant asse Sir G. Carteret did harangue upon the abuse of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">Tickets</a> did make me mad almost and yet was fain to hold my tongue. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, vexed mightily to see how simply our greatest ministers do content themselves to understand and do things, while <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> service in the meantime lies a-bleeding.</p>

<p>At my office late writing letters till ready to drop down asleep with my late sitting up of late, and running up and down a-days. So to bed.</p>

		<p>This day was kept publiquely by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> command, as a fast day against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13153/">the Dutch warr</a>, and I betimes with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7645/">Mr. Tooker</a>, whom I have brought into the Navy to serve us as a husband to see goods timely shipped off from hence to the Fleete and other places, and took him with me to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, where by business I have been hindered a great while of going, did a very great deale of business, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there by promise find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, and he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> and I by coach to take the ayre; and, where we had formerly been, at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7501/">Hackney</a>, did there eat some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/377/">pullets</a> we carried with us, and some things of the house; and after a game or two at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5130/">shuffle-board</a>, home, and Creed lay with me; but, being sleepy, he had no mind to talk about business, which indeed I intended, by inviting him to lie with me, but I would not force it on him, and so to bed, he and I, and to sleep, being the first time I have been so much at my ease and taken so much fresh ayre these many weeks or months.</p>

		<p>At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> sat all the morning, where, in the absence of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> being angry about the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">tickets</a>, spoke of Sir W. Batten for speaking some words about the signing of tickets, and called Sir W. Batten in his discourse at the table to us (the clerks being withdrawn) &#8220;shitten foole,&#8221; which vexed me.</p>

<p>At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there set my business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/">lighters</a> buying for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, and I think he will do it for me to very great advantage, at which I am mightily rejoiced. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">Home</a> and after a mouthfull of dinner to the office, where till 6 o&#8217;clock, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there with Sir G. Carteret and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Brunkerd</a> attended the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> about the business of money.</p>

<p>I also went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6230/">Jervas&#8217;s</a>, my barber, for my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2325/">periwigg</a> that was mending there, and there do hear that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7853/">Jane</a> is quite undone, taking the idle fellow for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8236/">her husband</a> yet not married, and lay with him several weeks that had another wife and child, and she is now going into Ireland.</p>

<p>So called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> at the &#8217;Change and home, and at my office writing letters till one o&#8217;clock in the morning, that I was ready to fall down asleep again. Great talke of a new Comett; and it is certain one do now appear as bright as the late one at the best; but I have not seen it myself.</p>

		<p>Up betimes to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle
</a> about money to be got for the Navy, or else we must shut up shop. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> and up and down, doing not much; then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">London</a>, but to prevent <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy&#8217;s</a> dining with me (who I see is at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>) I went back again and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">Herbert&#8217;s</a> at Westminster, there sent for a bit of meat and dined, and then to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, and there with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke</a>, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> in my Lord Treasurer&#8217;s chamber with Sir Philip Warwicke till dark night, about fower hours talking of the business of the Navy Charge, and how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> do order business, keeping us in ignorance what he do with his money, and also Sir Philip did shew me nakedly <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> condition for money for the Navy; and he do assure me, unless the King can get some noblemen or rich money-gentlemen to lend him money, or to get <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> to do it, it is impossible to find money: we having already, as he says, spent one year&#8217;s share of the three-years&#8217; tax, which comes to 2,500,000<i>l.</i>. Being very glad of this day&#8217;s discourse in all but that I fear I shall quite lose <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, who knows that I have been privately here all this day with Sir Ph. Warwicke. However, I will order it so as to give him as little offence as I can. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

At noon dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>, and then to the getting some business looked over of his, and then I to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor&#8217;s</a>, where to have spoke with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and Council busy, I could not; then to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">Old Exchange</a> and there of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8438/">my new pretty seamstress</a> bought four <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5633/">bands</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where I found my house mighty neat and clean.

<p>The French Embassadors<sup id="fnr1-1665-04-08"><a href="#fn1-1665-04-08">1</a></sup> are come incognito before their train, which will hereafter be very pompous. It is thought they come to get our King to joyne with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> in helping him against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/">Flanders</a>, and they to do the like to us against Holland. We have laine a good while with a good fleete at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>. The Dutch not said yet to be out. We, as high as we make our shew, I am sure, are unable to set out another small fleete, if this should be worsted. Wherefore, God send us peace! I cry.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee of Tangier</a>, where, contrary to all expectation, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a>, being vexed with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy&#8217;s</a> accounts, did propose it as necessary that Povy should be still continued <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/">Treasurer of Tangier</a> till he had made up his accounts; and with such arguments as, I confess, I was not prepared to answer, but by putting off of the discourse, and so, I think, brought it right again; but it troubled me so all the day after, and night too, that I was not quiet, though I think it doubtfull whether I shall be much the worse for it or no, if it should come to be so.</p>

<p>Dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and thence to White Hall again (where I lose most of my time now-a-days to my great trouble, charge, and loss of time and benefit), and there, after the Council rose, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Brunkard</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8284/">Sir Thomas Harvy</a>, and myself, down to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a> chamber to him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">the Chancellor</a>, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>; and there I did give them a large account of the charge of the Navy, and want of money. But strange to see how they held up their hands crying, &#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; Says my Lord Treasurer, &#8220;Why, what means all this, Mr. Pepys? This is true, you say; but what would you have me to do? I have given all I can for my life. Why will not people lend their money? Why will they not trust <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> as well as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/796/">Oliver</a>? Why do our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prizes</a> come to nothing, that yielded so much heretofore?&#8221; And this was all we could get, and went away without other answer, which is one of the saddest things that, at such a time as this, with the greatest action on foot that ever was in England, nothing should be minded, but let things go on of themselves do as well as they can.</p>

<p>So home, vexed, and going to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">Lady Batten&#8217;s</a>, there found a great many women with her, in her chamber merry, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">her daughter</a>, among others; where my Lady Pen flung me down upon the bed, and herself and others, one after another, upon me, and very merry we were, and thence I home and called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> with my Lady Pen to supper, and very merry as I could be, being vexed as I was.</p>

<p>So home to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and betimes to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>, being desirous to have an end of my trouble of mind touching my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> business, whether he hath any desire of accepting what my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a> offered, of his becoming <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/">Treasurer</a> again; and there I did, with a seeming most generous spirit, offer him to take it back again upon his owne terms; but he did answer to me that he would not above all things in the world, at which I was for the present satisfied; but, going away thence and speaking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, he puts me in doubt that the very nature of the thing will require that he be put in again; and did give me the reasons of the auditors, which, I confess, are so plain, that I know not how to withstand them. But he did give me most ingenious advice what to do in it, and anon, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/">Lord Barkeley</a> and some of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/920/">Commissioners</a> coming together, though not in a meeting, I did procure that they should order Povy&#8217;s payment of his remain of accounts to me; which order if it do pass will put a good stop to the fastening of the thing upon me.</p>

<p>At noon Creed and I to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1044/">cook&#8217;s shop</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Cross</a>, and there dined and had much discourse, and his very good upon my business, and upon other things, among the rest upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/549/">Will Howe&#8217;s</a> dissembling with us, we discovering one to another his carriage to us, present and absent, being a very false fellow. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> again, and there spent the afternoon, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to fetch a letter for the Council, and so back to White Hall, where walked an hour with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8019/">Mr. Wren</a>, of my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3337/">Mr. Ager</a>, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a> and called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and with her through the city to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7710/">Mile-End</a> Greene, and eat some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/389/">creame</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/395/">cakes</a> and so back home, and I a little at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This morning I was saluted with newes that the fleetes, ours and the Dutch, were engaged, and that the guns were heard at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2470/">Walthamstow</a> to play all yesterday, and that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/659/">Captain Teddiman&#8217;s</a> legs were shot off in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5177/">Royall Katherine</a>. But before night I hear the contrary, both by letters of my owne and messengers thence, that they were all well of our side and no enemy appears yet, and that the Royall Katherine is come to the fleete, and likely to prove as good a ship as any <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> hath, of which I am heartily glad, both for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1809/">Christopher Pett&#8217;s</a> sake and Captain Teddiman that is in her.</p>

Lay long in bed, then up and to my chamber and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, looking over some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6261/">plates</a> which I find necessary for me to understand pretty well, because of the Dutch warr. Then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> dined with us, and so after dinner he and I walked to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8458/">Rolls&#8217; Chappell</a>, expecting to hear the great <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8459/">Stillingfleete</a> preach, but he did not; but a very sorry fellow, which vexed me. The sermon done, we parted, and I home, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Mr. Andrews</a>, and by and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7624/">Captain Taylor</a>, my old acquaintance at Westminster, that understands musique very well and composes mighty bravely; he brought us some things of two parts to sing, very hard; but that that is the worst, he is very conceited of them, and that though they are good makes them troublesome to one, to see him every note commend and admire them. He supped with me, and a good understanding man he is and a good scholler, and, among other things, a great antiquary, and among other things he can, as he says, show the very originall Charter to Worcester, of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8460/">King Edgar&#8217;s</a>, wherein he stiles himself, Rex Marium Brittanniae, &amp;c.; which is the great text that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3339/">Mr. Selden</a> and others do quote, but imperfectly and upon trust. But he hath the very originall, which he says he will shew me.</p>

<p>He gone we to bed.</p>

<p>This night I am told that newes is come of our taking of three Dutch men-of-warr, with the loss of one of our Captains.</p>

		<p>Up and to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle&#8217;s</a>, where he shewed me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry&#8217;s</a> letters, how three Dutch privateers are taken, in one whereof <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8474/">Everson&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8473/">son</a> is captaine. But they have killed poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8475/">Captaine Golding</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8476/">The Diamond</a>. Two of them, one of 32 and the other of 20 odd guns, did stand stoutly up against her, which hath 46, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8477/">Yarmouth</a> that hath 52 guns, and as many more men as they. So that they did more than we could expect, not yielding till many of their men were killed. And Everson, when he was brought before the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a>, and was observed to be shot through the hat, answered, that he wished it had gone through his head, rather than been taken. One thing more is written: that two of our ships the other day appearing upon the coast of Holland, they presently fired their beacons round the country to give notice. And newes is brought <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, that the Dutch <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10591/">Smyrna</a> fleete is seen upon the back of Scotland; and thereupon the King hath wrote to the Duke, that he do appoint a fleete to go to the Northward to try to meet them coming home round: which God send!</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>; where the King seeing me, did come to me, and calling me by name, did discourse with me about the ships in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a>: and this is the first time that ever I knew the King did know me personally; so that hereafter I must not go thither, but with expectation to be questioned, and to be ready to give good answers.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and thence with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, who come to dine with me, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2190/">Old James</a>, where we dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4966/">Cutler</a>, and, by and by, being called by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, we all to a play, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8478/">&#8220;The Ghosts,&#8221;</a> at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2935/">Duke&#8217;s house</a>, but a very simple play.</p>

<p>Thence up and down, with my wife with me, to look [for] <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke</a> (Mr. Creed going from me), but missed of him and so home, and late and busy at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This day was left at my house a very neat silver watch, by one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8479/">Briggs</a>, a scrivener and sollicitor, at which I was angry with my wife for receiving, or, at least, for opening the box wherein it was, and so far witnessing our receipt of it, as to give the messenger 5<i>s.</i> for bringing it; but it can&#8217;t be helped, and I will endeavour to do the man a kindnesse, he being a friend of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/911/">uncle Wight&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J.

		<p>Up by five o&#8217;clock, and by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>; and there took coach, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/340/">Mr. Moore</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2610/">Chelsy</a>; where, after all my fears what doubts and difficulties my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1219/">Lord Privy Seale</a> would make at my Tangier Privy Seale, he did pass it at first reading, without my speaking with him. And then called me in, and was very civil to me. I passed my time in contemplating (before I was called in) the picture of my Lord&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7524/">son&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8482/">lady</a>, a most beautiful woman, and most like to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/337/">Mrs. Butler</a>. Thence very much joyed to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">London</a> back again, and found out <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>; told him this; and then went and left my Privy Seale at my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>; and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6390/">Trinity-House</a>; where a great dinner of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8483/">Captain Crisp</a>, who is made an Elder Brother. And so, being very pleasant at dinner, away home, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> with me; and there met Povy; and we to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, where we saw some experiments upon a hen, a dogg, and a cat, of the Florence poyson.<sup id="fnr1-1665-04-19"><a href="#fn1-1665-04-19">1</a></sup> The first it made for a time drunk, but it come to itself again quickly; the second it made vomitt mightily, but no other hurt. The third I did not stay to see the effect of it, being taken out by Povy. He and I walked below together, he giving me most exceeding discouragements in the getting of money (whether by design or no I know not, for I am now come to think him a most cunning fellow in most things he do, but his accounts), and made it plain to me that money will be hard to get, and that it is to be feared <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/967/">Backewell</a> hath a design in it to get the thing forced upon himself. This put me into a cruel melancholy to think I may lose what I have had so near my hand; but yet something may be hoped for which to-morrow will shew. He gone, Creed and I together a great while consulting what to do in this case, and after all I left him to do what he thought fit in his discourse to-morrow with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a>. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and in my way met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8455/">Mr. Warren</a>, from whom my hopes I fear will fail of what I hoped for, by my getting him a protection. But all these troubles will if not be over, yet we shall see the worst of there in a day or two. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and thence to supper, and my head akeing, betimes, that is by 10 or 11 o&#8217;clock, to bed.</p>

At noon dined, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a> by agreement with me (where his boldness with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, poor innocent wench, did make both her and me blush, to think how he were able to debauch a poor girl if he had opportunity) at a dish or two of plain meat of his own choice. After dinner comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a>, where want of money to Andrews the main discourse, and at last in confidence of Creed&#8217;s judgement I am resolved to spare him 4 or 500<i>l.</i> of what lies by me upon the security of some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">Tallys</a>. This went against my heart to begin, but when obtaining Mr. Creed to joyne with me we do resolve to assist Mr. Andrews. Then anon we parted, and I to my office, where late, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to supper and to bed. This night I am told the first play is played in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8484/">noon-hall</a>, which is now turned to a house of playing.

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>, according to promise, sent his coach betimes, and I carried <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">her woman</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1042/">White Hall Chappell</a> and set them in the Organ Loft, and I having left to untruss went to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5782/">Harp and Ball</a> and there drank also, and entertained myself in talke with the mayde of the house, a pretty mayde and very modest. Thence to the Chappell and heard the famous young <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8459/">Stillingfleete</a>, whom I knew at Cambridge, and is now newly admitted one of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> chaplains; and was presented, they say, to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a> for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8485/">St. Andrew&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/530/">Holborne</a>, where he is now minister, with these words: that they (the Bishops of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2519/">Canterbury</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7308/">London</a>, and another) believed he is the ablest young man to preach the Gospel of any since the Apostles. He did make the most plain, honest, good, grave sermon, in the most unconcerned and easy yet substantial manner, that ever I heard in my life, upon the words of Samuell to the people, &#8220;Fear the Lord in truth with all your heart, and remember the great things that he hath done for you.&#8221; It being proper to this day, the day of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14066/">the King&#8217;s Coronation</a>.</p>

<p>Thence to Mr. Povy&#8217;s, where mightily treated, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> with us. But Lord! to see how Povy overdoes every thing in commending it, do make it nauseous to me, and was not (by reason of my large praise of his house) over acceptable to my wife. Thence after dinner Creed and we by coach took the ayre in the fields beyond St. Pancras, it raining now and then, which it seems is most welcome weather, and then all to my house, where comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7624/">Captain Taylor</a>, and good musique, but at supper to hear the arguments we had against Taylor concerning a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6225/">Corant</a>, he saying that the law of a dancing Corant is to have every barr to end in a pricked crochet and quaver, which I did deny, was very strange. It proceeded till I vexed him, but all parted friends, for Creed and I to laugh at when he was gone. After supper, Creed and I together to bed, in Mercer&#8217;s bed, and so to sleep.</p>

		<p>Up and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a> coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>. Sir W. Batten and I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, where very busy. Then I to Creed&#8217;s chamber, where I received with much ado my two orders about receiving <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy&#8217;s</a> monies and answering his credits, and it is strange how he will preserve his constant humour of delaying all business that comes before him.</p>

<p>Thence he and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">London</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and back again to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">Lady Sandwich&#8217;s</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> by agreement.</p>

<p>After dinner alone, my Lady told me, with the prettiest kind of doubtfullnesse, whether it would be fit for her with respect to Creed to do it, that is, in the world, that Creed had broke his desire to her of being a servant to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7294/">Mrs. Betty Pickering</a>, and placed it upon encouragement which he had from some discourse of her ladyship, commending of her virtues to him, which, poor lady, she meant most innocently. She did give him a cold answer, but not so severe as it ought to have been; and, it seems, as the lady since to my Lady confesses, he had wrote a letter to her, which she answered slightly, and was resolved to contemn any motion of his therein. My Lady takes the thing very ill, as it is fit she should; but I advise her to stop all future occasions of the world&#8217;s taking notice of his coming thither so often as of late he hath done. But to think that he should have this devilish presumption to aime at a lady so near to my Lord is strange, both for his modesty and discretion.</p>

<p>Thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/179/">Cockepitt</a>, and there walked an houre with my Lord Duke of Albemarle alone in his garden, where he expressed in great words his opinion of me; that I was the right hand of the Navy here, nobody but I taking any care of any thing therein; so that he should not know what could be done without me. At which I was (from him) not a little proud. Thence to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee of Tangier</a>, where because not a quorum little was done, and so away to my wife (Creed with me) at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce&#8217;s</a>, who continues very pretty and is now great with child. I had not seen her a great while. Thence by coach to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, but could not speak with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke</a>. So by coach with my wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/719/">the Parke</a>; but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> being there, and I now-a-days being doubtfull of being seen in any pleasure, did part from the tour, and away out of the Parke to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7649/">Knightsbridge</a>, and there eat and drank in the coach, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and after a while at my office, home to supper and to bed, having got a great cold I think by my pulling off my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/517/">periwigg</a> so often.</p>

		<p>Up very betimes, my cold continuing and my stomach sick with the buttered ale that I did drink the last night in bed, which did lie upon me till I did this morning vomitt it up.</p>

<p>So walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> met me, and there I did receive the first parcel of money as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/">Treasurer of Tangier</a>, and did give him my receipt for it, which was about 2,800<i>l.</i> value in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">Tallys</a>; we did also examine and settle several other things, and then I away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, talking, with Povy alone, about my opinion of Creed&#8217;s indiscretion in looking after <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7294/">Mrs. Pickering</a>, desiring him to make no more a sport of it, but to correct him, if he finds that he continues to owne any such thing. This I did by my Lady&#8217;s desire, and do intend to pursue the stop of it.</p>

<p>So to the Carrier&#8217;s by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7465/">Cripplegate</a>, to see whether <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> be come to towne or no, I expecting her to-day, but she is not come. So to dinner to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">Lady Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, and there after dinner above in the diningroom did spend an houre or two with her talking again about Creed&#8217;s folly; but strange it is that he should dare to propose this business himself of Mrs. Pickering to my Lady, and to tell my Lady that he did it for her virtue sake, not minding her money, for he could have a wife with more, but, for that, he did intend to depend upon her Ladyshipp to get as much of her father and mother for her as she could; and that, what he did, was by encouragement from discourse of her Ladyshipp&#8217;s: he also had wrote to Mrs. Pickering, but she did give him a slighting answer back again. But I do very much fear that Mrs. Pickering&#8217;s honour, if the world comes to take notice of it, may be wronged by it.</p>

<p>Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and all the afternoon till night at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, then home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, where all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> dined with me; and, after dinner, walked in the garden, he telling me that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a> now begins to be scrupulous, and will know what becomes of the 26,000<i>l.</i> saved by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/">Lord Peterborough</a>, before he parts with any more money, which puts us into new doubts, and me into a great fear, that all my cake will be doe still.<sup id="fnr1-1665-04-27"><a href="#fn1-1665-04-27">1</a></sup> But I am well prepared for it to bear it, being not clear whether it will be more for my profit to have it, or go without it, as my profits of the Navy are likely now to be.</p>

<p>All the afternoon till late hard at the office. Then to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This night <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">William Hewer</a> is returned from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, where he hath been paying off of some ships this fortnight, and went to sea a good way with the fleete, which was 96 in company then, men of warr, besides some come in, and following them since, which makes now above 100, whom God bless!</p>

		<p>Up by 5 o&#8217;clock, and by appointment with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> by 6 at his chamber, expecting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a>, who come not. Thence he and I out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke&#8217;s</a>, but being not up we took a turn in the garden hard by, and thither comes Povy to us. After some discourse of the reason of the difficulty that Sir Philip Warwicke makes in issuing a warrant for my striking of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, namely, the having a clear account of the 26,000<i>l.</i> saved by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/">Lord of Peterborough</a>, we parted, and I to Sir P. Warwicke, who did give me an account of his demurr, which I applied myself to remove by taking Creed with me to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a>, from whom, contrary to all expectation, I received a very kind answer, just as we could have wished it, that he would satisfy my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a>.</p>

<p>Thence very well satisfied I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and down <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a> to visit the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a>-ships, where I find all out of order. And come home to dinner, and then to write a letter to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> about the victualling-ships, and carried it myself to the Council-chamber, where it was read; and when they rose, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> passing by stroked me on the head, and told me that the Board had read my letter, and taken order for the punishing of the watermen for not appearing on board the ships.<sup id="fnr1-1665-04-28"><a href="#fn1-1665-04-28">1</a></sup> And so did <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> afterwards, who do now know me so well, that he never sees me but he speaks to me about our Navy business.</p>

<p>Thence got my Lord Ashly to my Lord Treasurer below in his chamber, and there removed the scruple, and by and by brought <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8214/">Mr. Sherwin</a> to Sir Philip Warwicke and did the like, and so home, and after a while at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, to bed.</p>

		<p>All the morning busy at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. In the afternoon to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, and there got my Lord Treasurer to sign the warrant for my striking of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, and so doing many jobbs in my way <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there late writeing letters, being troubled in my mind to hear that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> do take notice that I am now-a-days much from the office upon no office business, which vexes me, and will make me mind my business the better, I hope in God; but what troubles me more is, that I do omit to write, as I should do, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a>, which I must not do, though this night I minded it so little as to sleep in the middle of my letter to him, and committed forty blotts and blurrs in my letter to him, but of this I hope never more to be guilty, if I have not already given him sufficient offence. So, late home, and to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> alone all the morning, making up my monthly accounts, which though it hath been very intricate, and very great disbursements and receipts and odd reckonings, yet I differed not from the truth; viz.: between my first computing what my profit ought to be and then what my cash and debts do really make me worth, not above 10<i>s.</i>, which is very much, and I do much value myself upon the account, and herein I with great joy find myself to have gained this month above 100<i>l.</i> clear, and in the whole to be <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">worth above 1400<i>l.</i></a>, the greatest sum I ever yet was worth.</p>

<p>Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and there find poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1060/">Mr. Spong</a> walking at my door, where he had knocked, and being told I was at the office staid modestly there walking because of disturbing me, which methinks was one of the most modest acts (of a man that hath no need of being so to me) that ever I knew in my life.</p>

<p>He dined with me, and then after dinner to my closet, where abundance of mighty pretty discourse, wherein, in a word, I find him the man of the world that hath of his own ingenuity obtained the most in most things, being withall no scholler. He gone, I took boat and down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, and made it late home, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>Thus I end this month in great content as to my estate and gettings: in much trouble as to the pains I have taken, and the rubs I expect yet to meet with, about the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>. The fleete, with about 106 ships upon the coast of Holland, in sight of the Dutch, within the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8500/">Texel</a>. Great fears of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">the sickenesse</a> here in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve as all!</p>
