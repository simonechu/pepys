		<p>Up, and all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, getting the list of all the ships and vessels employed since the war, for the Committee of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>. At noon with it to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a> chamber, and there dined with him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">[Sir] W. Batten</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a>, and after dinner examined it and find it will do us much right in the number of men rising to near the expense we delivered to the Parliament. [Sir] W. Coventry and I (the others going before the Committee) to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker&#8217;s</a> for his hand, and find him simply mighty busy in a council of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">Queen&#8217;s</a>. He come out and took in the papers to sign, and sent them mighty wisely out again. Sir W. Coventry away to the Committee, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9583/">the Mercer&#8217;s</a>, and there took a bill of what I owe of late, which comes to about 17<i>l.</i>. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there did hear <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Michell</a> was at this end of the towne, and so without breach of vowe did stay to endeavour to meet with her and carry her home; but she did not come, so I lost my whole afternoon. But pretty! how I took another pretty woman for her, taking her a clap on the breech, thinking verily it had been her. Staid till [Sir] W. Batten and [Sir] W. Pen come out, and so away home by water with them, and to the office to do some business, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> do tell me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> tells her that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> hath no mind to come. So I was angry at it, and resolved with her to have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3671/">Falconbridge&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">girle</a>, and I think it will be better for us, and will please me better with singing. With this resolution, to supper and to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and am sent for to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and to him, and there he tells me how our lists are referred to a Sub-committee to consider and examine, and that I am ordered to be there this afternoon. So I away thence to my new <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10410/">bookbinder</a> to see my books gilding in the backs, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to the House, and spoke to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, where he told me I must attend the Committee in the afternoon, and received some hints of more work to do. So I away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the &#8217;Chequer</a>, and thence to an alehouse, and found <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3671/">Mr. Falconbridge</a>, and agreed for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">his kinswoman</a> to come to me. He says she can dress <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and will do anything we would have her to do, and is of a good spirit and mighty cheerful. He is much pleased therewith, and so we shall be. So agreed for her coming the next week. So away <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and eat a short dinner, and then with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> to White Hall, and do give his boy my book of papers to hold while he went into the Committee Chamber in the Inner Court of Wards, and I walked without with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2267/">Mr. Slingsby</a>, of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>, who was there, and who did in walking inform me mightily in several things; among others, that the heightening or lowering of money is only a cheat, and do good to some particular men, which, if I can but remember how, I am now by him fully convinced of. Anon Sir W. Pen went away, telling me that Sir W. Coventry that was within had told him that the fleete is all come into the buoy of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8827/">Nore</a>, and that he must hasten down to them, and so went away, and I into the Committee Chamber before the Committee sat, and there heard <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1218/">Birch</a> discourse highly and understandingly about the Navy business and a proposal made heretofore to farm the Navy; but Sir W. Coventry did abundantly answer him, and is a most excellent person. By and by the Committee met, and I walked out, and anon they rose and called me in, and appointed me to attend a Committee of them to-morrow at the office to examine our lists. This put me into a mighty fear and trouble; they doing it in a very ill humour, methought. So I away and called on my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> to desire him to be there to-morrow, and so home, having taken up my wife at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>, full of trouble in mind to think what I shall be obliged to answer, that am neither fully fit, nor in any measure concerned to take the shame and trouble of this office upon me, but only from the inability and folly of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">the Comptroller</a> that occasions it. When come home I to Sir W. Pen&#8217;s, to his boy, for my book, and there find he hath it not, but delivered it to the doorekeeper of the Committee for me. This, added to my former disquiet, made me stark mad, considering all the nakedness of the office lay open in papers within those covers. I could not tell in the world what to do, but was mad on all sides, and that which made me worse <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> was there, and he did so swear and curse at the boy that told me. So Cocke, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/">Griffin</a>, and the boy with me, they to find the housekeeper of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10411/">Hughes</a>, while I to Sir W. Coventry, but could hear nothing of it there. But coming to our rendezvous at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2593/">Swan Taverne</a>, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/195/">King Streete</a>, I find they have found the housekeeper, and the book simply locked up in the Court. So I staid and drank, and rewarded the doore-keeper, and away home, my heart lighter by all this, but to bed very sad notwithstanding, in fear of what will happen to-morrow upon their coming.</p>

		<p>Waked betimes, mightily troubled in mind, and in the most true trouble that I ever was in my life, saving in the business last year of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2494/">East India</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prizes</a>. So up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Mr. Hater</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/">Griffin</a> to consider of our business, and books and papers necessary for this examination; and by and by, by eight o&#8217;clock, comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1218/">Birch</a>, the first, with the lists and books of accounts delivered in. He calls me to work, and there he and I begun, when, by and by, comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10412/">Garraway</a>, the first time I ever saw him, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10413/">Sir W. Thompson</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10414/">Mr. Boscawen</a>. They to it, and I did make shift to answer them better than I expected. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a>, come in, but presently went out; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">[Sir] J. Minnes</a> come in, and said two or three words from the purpose, but to do hurt; and so away he went also, and left me all the morning with them alone to stand or fall. At noon Sir W. Batten comes to them to invite them (though fast day) to dinner, which they did, and good company they were, but especially Garraway. Here I have news brought me of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father&#8217;s</a> coming to town, and I presently to him, glad to see him, poor man, he being come to town unexpectedly to see us and the city. I could not stay with him, but after dinner to work again, only the Committee and I, till dark night, and by that time they cast up all the lists, and found out what the medium of men was borne all the war, of all sorts, and ended with good peace, and much seeming satisfaction; but I find them wise and reserved, and instructed to hit all our blots, as among others, that we reckon the ships full manned from the beginning. They gone, and my heart eased of a great deale of fear and pain, and reckoning myself to come off with victory, because not overcome in anything or much foiled, I away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a> chamber, but he not within, then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there among the ladies, and saw my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemaine</a> never looked so ill, nor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a> neither, as in this plain, natural dress. I was not pleased with either of them. Away, not finding [Sir] W. Coventry, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there find my father and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> come to towne &#8212; my father without my expectation; but glad I am to see him. And so to supper with him, and to work again at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>; then home, to set up all my folio books, which are come home gilt on the backs, very handsome to the eye, and then at midnight to bed. This night [Sir] W. Pen told me [Sir] W. Batten swears he will have nothing to do with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10396/">the Privateer</a> if <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10399/">his son</a> do not go Lieutenant, which angers me and him; but we will be even with him, one way or other.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1666/10/04/">Thursday 4 October 1666</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and mighty betimes, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">[Sir] W. Coventry</a>, to give him an account of yesterday&#8217;s work, which do give him good content. He did then tell me his speech lately to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a> in his owne vindication about the report of his selling of places, he having a small occasion offered him by chance, which he did desire, and took, and did it to his content, and, he says, to the House&#8217;s seeming to approve of it by their hum. He confessed how long he had done it, and how he desired to have something else; and, since then, he had taken nothing, and challenged all the world. I was glad of this also. Thence up to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, by appointment, with fellow <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1121/">officers</a>, to complaine, but to no purpose, of want of money, and so away. I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, to his lodging, and here discoursed much of the want of money and our being designed for destruction. How <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> hath lost his power, by submitting himself to this way of examining his accounts, and is become but as a private man. He says the King is troubled at it, but they talk an entry shall be made, that it is not to be brought into example; that the King must, if they do not agree presently, make them a courageous speech, which he says he may do, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City of London</a> being now burned, and himself master of an army, better than any prince before him, and so I believe. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, about noon, to dinner. After dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10410/">the book binder</a> come, and I sent by him some more books to gild. I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all day, and spent most of it with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, whom I have had no discourse with a great while, and when all is done I do find him a mighty wise man as any I know, and his counsel as much to be followed. Late with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Mr. Hater</a> upon comparing the charge and husbandry of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12848/">the last Dutch war</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13153/">ours now</a>, and do find good roome to think we have done little worse than they, whereof good use may and will be made. So home to supper, and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> talking awhile, then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there troubled with a message from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/">Lord Peterborough</a> about money; but I did give as kind answer as I could, though I hate him. Then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> to discourse about paying of part of the great ships come in, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> again to compare the comparison of the two <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12848/">Dutch</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13153/">wars&#8217;</a> charges for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">[Sir] W.

After dinner to look over my papers, and comparing them with some notes of his and brought me, the sight of some good Navy notes of his which I shall get. Then examined and liked well my notes, and away together to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, in the way discoursing the inconvenience of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> being thus subject to an account, but it will be remedied for the time to come, he thinks, if we can get this over, and I find he will have the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/485/">Comptroller&#8217;s</a> business better done, swearing he will never be for a wit to be employed on business again. Thence I home, and back again to White Hall, and meeting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a> to White Hall; there walked till night that the Committee come down, and there Sir W. Coventry tells me that the Subcommittee have made their report to the Grand Committee, and in pretty kind terms, and have agreed upon allowing us 4<i>l.</i> per head, which I am sure will do the business, but he had endeavoured to have got more, but this do well, and he and I are both mighty glad it is come to this, and the heat of the present business seems almost over. But I have more worke cut out for me, to prepare a list of the extraordinaries, not to be included within the 4<i>l.</i>, against Monday. So I away from him, and met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">the Vice-Chamberlain</a>, and I told him when I had this evening in coming hither met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a>, and he told me of a wild motion made in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/293/">House of Lords</a> by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a> for all men that had cheated the King to be declared traitors and felons, and that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> was named. This put me into a great pain, so the Vice-Chamberlain, who had heard nothing of it, having been all day in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, away with me to White Hall; and there come to me and told me that, upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly&#8217;s</a> asking their direction whether, being a peere, he should bring in his accounts to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the Commons</a>, which they did give way to, the Duke of Buckingham did move that, for the time to come, what I have written above might be declared by some fuller law than heretofore. Lord Ashly answered, that it was not the fault of the present laws, but want of proof; and so said the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a>. He answered, that a better law, he thought, might be made so the House laughing, did refer it to him to bring in a Bill to that purpose, and this was all. So I away with joyful heart home, calling on Cocke and telling him the same. So I away home to the office to clear my Journall for five days, and so home to supper and to bed, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> who had staid out late and troubled me thereat being come home well and gone to bed, which pleases me also. This day, coming home, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/">Mr. Kirton&#8217;s</a> kinsman, my bookseller, come in my way; and so I am told by him that Mr. Kirton is utterly undone, and made 2 or 3000<i>l.</i> worse than nothing, from being worth 7 or 8,000<i>l.</i>. That the goods laid in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/182/">the Churchyarde</a> fired through the windows those in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10394/">St. Fayth&#8217;s church</a>; and those coming to the warehouses&#8217; doors fired them, and burned all the books and the pillars of the church, so as the roof falling down, broke quite down, which it did not do in the other places of the church, which is alike pillared (which I knew not before); but being not burned, they stand still. He do believe there is above; 50,000<i>l.</i> of books burned; all the great booksellers almost undone: not only these, but their warehouses at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10393/">their Hall</a>, and under <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10068/">Christchurch</a>, and elsewhere being all burned. A great want thereof there will be of books, specially Latin books and foreign books; and, among others, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10415/">the Polyglottes</a> and new <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/362/">Bible</a>, which he believes will be presently worth 40<i>l.</i> a-piece.</p>

		<p>Up, and having seen <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> in his cassocke, which I am not the most satisfied in, being doubtfull at this time what course to have him profess too soon. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and there busy about a list of the extraordinaries of the charge of the fleete this war; and was led to go to the office of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5016/">the ordnance</a> to be satisfied in something, and find their accounts and books kept in mighty good order, but that they can give no light, nor will the nature of their affairs permit it to tell what the charge of the ordnance comes to a man a month. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> again and to dinner, there coming <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> to me; but what with business and my hatred to the man, I did not spend any time with him, but after dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">[my] wife</a> and he and I took coach and to Westminster, but he &#8217;light about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/">Paul&#8217;s</a>, and set her at her tailor&#8217;s, and myself to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, but there missing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">[Sir] W. Coventry</a>, returned and took up my wife, and calling at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a> home, whither <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a> come to visit me, but my business suffered me not to stay with him. So he gone I by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> and thence to St. James&#8217;s, and there found [Sir] W. Coventry waiting for me, and I did give him a good account to his mind of the business he expected about extraordinaries and then fell to other talke, among others, our sad condition contracted by want of a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/485/">Comptroller</a>;<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-06"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-06">1</a></sup> and it was his words, that he believes, besides all the shame and trouble he hath brought on the office, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> had better have given 100,000<i>l.</i> than ever have had him there. He did discourse about some of these discontented <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>-men, and says that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1218/">Birch</a> is a false rogue, but that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10412/">Garraway</a> is a man that hath not been well used by the Court, though very stout to death, and hath suffered all that is possible for the King from the beginning. But discontented as he is, yet he never knew a Session of Parliament but he hath done some good deed for the King before it rose. I told him the passage <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Cocke</a> told me of his having begged a brace of bucks of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> for him, and when it come to him, he sent it back again. Sir W. Coventry told me, it is much to be pitied that the King should lose the service of a man so able and faithfull; and that he ought to be brought over, but that it is always observed, that by bringing over one discontented man, you raise up three in his room; which is a State lesson I never knew before. But when others discover your fear, and that discontent procures favour, they will be discontented too, and impose on you. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> and got a coach and home, and there did business late, and so home and set up my little books of one of my presses come home gilt, which pleases me mightily, and then to bed. This morning my wife told me of a fine gentlewoman my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> tells her of, for 20<i>l.</i> per annum, that sings, dances, plays on four or five instruments and many other fine things, which pleases me mightily: and she sent to have her see her, which she did this afternoon; but sings basely, and is a tawdry wench that would take 8<i>l.</i>, but [neither] my wife nor I think her fit to come.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and after visiting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> in his chamber, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Little Michell</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">his wife</a> come to dine with us, which they did, and then presently after dinner I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where met by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, to attend <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> at the Cabinet; but nobody had determined what to speak of, but only in general to ask for money. So I was forced immediately to prepare in my mind a method of discoursing. And anon we were called in to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10481/">Green Room</a>, where the King, Duke of York, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, [Sirs] <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">G. Carteret</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">W. Coventry</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5947/">Morrice</a>. Nobody beginning, I did, and made a current, and I thought a good speech, laying open the ill state of the Navy: by the greatness of the debt; greatness of work to do against next yeare; the time and materials it would take; and our incapacity, through a total want of money. I had no sooner done, but Prince Rupert rose up and told the King in a heat, that whatever the gentleman had said, he had brought home his fleete in as good a condition as ever any fleete was brought home; that twenty boats would be as many as the fleete would want: and all the anchors and cables left in the storm might be taken up again. This arose from my saying, among other things we had to do, that the fleete was come in &#8212; the greatest fleete that ever his Majesty had yet together, and that in as bad condition as the enemy or weather could put it; and to use <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a> words, who is upon the place taking a survey, he dreads the reports he is to receive from the Surveyors of its defects. I therefore did only answer, that I was sorry for his Highness&#8217;s offence, but that what I said was but the report we received from those entrusted in the fleete to inform us. He muttered and repeated what he had said; and so, after a long silence on all hands, nobody, not so much as the Duke of Albemarle, seconding the Prince, nor taking notice of what he said, we withdrew. I was not a little troubled at this passage, and the more when speaking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1637/">Jacke Fenn</a> about it, he told me that the Prince will be asking now who this Pepys is, and find him to be a creature of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, and therefore this was done only to disparage him. Anon they broke, up, and Sir W. Coventry come out; so I asked his advice. He told me he had said something to salve it, which was, that his Highnesse had, he believed, rightly informed the King that the fleete is come in good condition to have staid out yet longer, and have fought the enemy, but yet that Mr. Pepys his meaning might be, that, though in so good condition, if they should come in and lie all the winter, we shall be very loth to send them to sea for another year&#8217;s service with[out] great repairs. He said it would be no hurt if I went to him, and showed him the report himself brought up from the fleete, where every ship, by the Commander&#8217;s report, do need more or less, and not to mention more of Sir W. Pen for doing him a mischief. So I said I would, but do not think that all this will redound to my hurt, because the truth of what I said will soon appear. Thence, having been informed that, after all this pains, the King hath found out how to supply us with 5 or 6000<i>l.</i>, when 100,000<i>l.</i> were at this time but absolutely necessary, and we mentioned 50,000<i>l.</i>. This is every day a greater and greater omen of ruine. God fit us for it! Sir J. Minnes and I home (it raining) by coach, calling only on Sir G. Carteret at his lodging (who is I find troubled at my Lord Treasurer and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke</a> bungling in his accounts), and come home to supper with my father, and then all to bed. I made my brother in his cassocke to say grace this day, but I like his voice so ill that I begin to be sorry he hath taken this order upon him.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, called up by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7120/">Commissioner Middleton</a>, newly come to town, but staid not with me; so I to my office busy all the morning. Towards noon, by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there by several hear that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> do resolve to do something to retrench <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> great salary; but cannot hear of any thing bad they can lay to his charge. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">The House</a> did this day order to be engrossed the Bill against importing Irish cattle; a thing, it seems, carried on by the Western Parliament-men, wholly against the sense of most of the rest of the House; who think if you do this, you give the Irish again cause to rebel. Thus plenty on both sides makes us mad. The Committee of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10425/">Canary Company</a> of both factions come to me for my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/247/">Cozen Roger</a> that is of the Committee. Thence with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">[Sir] W. Coventry</a> when the House rose and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">[Sir] W. Batten</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, and there agreed of and signed our paper of extraordinaries, and there left them, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3671/">Mr. Falconbridge&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">girle</a> is, and by and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, who likes her well, though I confess I cannot (though she be of my finding out and sings pretty well), because she will be raised from so mean a condition to so high all of a sudden; but she will be much to our profit, more than <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, less expense. Here we bespoke anew gowne for her, and to come to us on Friday. She being gone, my wife and I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by coach, and then I presently by water with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Mr. Pierce</a> to Westminster Hall, he in the way telling me how the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> do not agree. The Duke of York is wholly given up to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10044/">this bitch</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1676/">Denham</a>. The Duke of Albemarle and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a> do less agree. So that we are all in pieces, and nobody knows what will be done the next year. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">The King</a> hath yesterday in Council declared his resolution of setting a fashion for clothes, which he will never alter.<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-08"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-08">1</a></sup> It will be a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10449/">vest</a>, I know not well how; but it is to teach the nobility thrift, and will do good. By and by comes down from the Committee [Sir] W. Coventry, and I find him troubled at several things happened this afternoon, which vexes me also; our business looking worse and worse, and our worke growing on our hands. Time spending, and no money to set anything in hand with; the end thereof must be speedy ruine. The Dutch insult and have taken off <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10426/">Bruant&#8217;s</a> head, which they have not dared to do (though found guilty of the fault he did die for, of something of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/781/">Prince of Orange&#8217;s</a> faction) till just now, which speaks more confidence in our being worse than before. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5350/">Alderman Maynell</a>, I hear, is dead. Thence returned in the darke by coach all alone, full of thoughts of the consequences of this ill complexion of affairs, and how to save myself and the little I have, which if I can do, I have cause to bless God that I am so well, and shall be well contented to retreat to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a>, and spend the rest of my days there. So to my office, and did some business, and finished my Journall with resolutions, if God bless me, to apply myself soberly to settle all matters for myself, and expect the event of all with comfort. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

Thence with him to Westminster, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1171/">parish church</a>, where the Parliament-men, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8459/">Stillingfleete</a> in the pulpit. So full, no standing there; so he and I to eat herrings at the Dog Taverne. And then to church again, and there was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10428/">Mr. Frampton</a> in the pulpit, they cry up so much, a young man, and of a mighty ready tongue. I heard a little of his sermon, and liked it; but the crowd so great, I could not stay. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, and &#8216;baise <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">la fille</a>&#8216;, and drank, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by coach, and took <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">father</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">wife</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">brother</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2594/">Islington</a>, where I find mine host dead. Here eat and drank, and merry; and so home, and to the office a while, and then to Sir W. Batten to talk a while, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> into the office to hear his newes, who is mighty conversant with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10412/">Garraway</a> and those people, who tells me what they object as to the maladministration of things as to money. But that they mean well, and will do well; but their reckonings are very good, and show great faults, as I will insert here. They say <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the king</a> hath had towards this war expressly thus much</p>

<p>He and I did bemoan our public condition. He tells me the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> is under a cloud, and they have a mind at Court to lay him aside. This I know not; but all things are not right with him, and I am glad of it, but sorry for the time. So home to supper, and to bed, it being my wedding night,<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-10"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-10">1</a></sup> but how many years I cannot tell; but my wife says ten.</p>

		<p>Up, and discoursed with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> of my sending some money for safety into the country, for I am in pain what to do with what I have. I did give him money, poor man, and he overjoyed. So left him, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where nothing but sad evidences of ruine coming on us for want of money. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, which was a very good dinner, my father, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">brother</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">wife</a> and I, and then to the office again, where I was all the afternoon till very late, busy, and then home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>Memorandum. I had taken my Journall during the fire and the disorders following in loose papers until this very day, and could not get time to enter them in my book till January 18, in the morning, having made my eyes sore by frequent attempts this winter to do it. But now it is done, for which I thank God, and pray never the like occasion may happen.</p>

		<p>Up, and after taking leave of my poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">father</a>, who is setting out this day for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a> by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2589/">Cambridge</a> coach, he having taken a journey to see the city <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">burned</a>, and to bring <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> to towne, I out by water; and so coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, the weather being foul; and there, from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, do hear how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a> have cut us off 150,000<i>l.</i> of our wear and tear, for that which was saved by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> while the fleete lay in harbour in winter. However, he seems pleased, and so am I, that they have abated no more, and do intend to allow of 28,000 men for the next year; and this day have appointed to declare the sum they will give the King,<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-12"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-12">1</a></sup> and to propose the way of raising it; so that this is likely to be the great day. This done in his chamber, I with him to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there took a few turns, the Hall mighty full of people, and the House likely to be very full to-day about the money business. Here I met with several people, and do find that people have a mighty mind to have a fling at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Vice-Chamberlain</a>, if they could lay hold of anything, his place being, indeed, too much for such, they think, or any single subject of no greater parts and quality than he, to enjoy. But I hope he may weather all, though it will not be by any dexterity of his, I dare say, if he do stand, but by his fate only, and people&#8217;s being taken off by other things. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by coach, mighty dirty weather, and then to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11011/">Treasurer&#8217;s office</a> and got a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">ticket</a> paid for my little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell</a>, and so again by coach to Westminster, and come presently after the House rose. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, and there sent for a piece of meat and dined alone and played with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">Sarah</a>, and so to the Hall a while, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin&#8217;s</a> lodging and did what I would with her. She is very big, and resolves I must be godfather. Thence away by water with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10429/">Cropp</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>. It was almost night before I got thither. So I did only give directions concerning a press that I have making there to hold my turning and joyner&#8217;s tooles that were lately given me, which will be very handsome, and so away back again, it being now dark, and so home, and there find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> come home, and hath brought her <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">new girle</a> I have helped her to, of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3671/">Mr. Falconbridge&#8217;s</a>. She is wretched poor; and but ordinary favoured; and we fain to lay out seven or eight pounds worth of clothes upon her back, which, methinks, do go against my heart; and I do not think I can ever esteem her as I could have done another that had come fine and handsome; and which is more, her voice, for want of use, is so furred, that it do not at present please me; but her manner of singing is such, that I shall, I think, take great pleasure in it. Well, she is come, and I wish us good fortune in her.</p>

<p>Here I met with notice of a meeting of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Commissioners for Tangier</a> tomorrow, and so I must have my accounts ready for them, which caused me to confine myself to my chamber presently and set to the making up my accounts, which I find very clear, but with much difficulty by reason of my not doing them sooner, things being out of my mind.

		<p>[Continued from <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/10/12/">yesterday</a>. P.G.] It cost me till four o&#8217;clock in the morning, and, which was pretty to think, I was above an hour, after I had made all right, in casting up of about twenty sums, being dozed with much work, and had for forty times together forgot to carry the 60 which I had in my mind, in one denomination which exceeded 60; and this did confound me for above an hour together. At last all even and done, and so to bed.</p>

<p>Up at seven, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, after looking over my last night&#8217;s work. We sat all the morning. At noon by coach with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> and &#8217;light at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a>, and so alone I to dinner at a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1044/">cooke&#8217;s</a>, and thence to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, whom I find kind; but he had drawn some new proposal to deliver to the Lords Commissioners to-day, wherein one was, that the garrison would not be well paid without some goldsmith&#8217;s undertaking the paying of the bills of exchange for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">Tallys</a>. He professing so much kindness to me, and saying that he would not be concerned in the garrison without me; and that if he continued in the employment, no man should have to do with the money but myself. I did ask his Lordship&#8217;s meaning of the proposition in his paper. He told me he had not much considered it, but that he meant no harm to me. I told him I thought it would render me useless; whereupon he did very frankly, after my seeming denials for a good while, cause it to be writ over again, and that clause left out, which did satisfy me abundantly. It being done, he and I together to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> (who is gone over to all his pleasures again, and leaves off care of business, what with his woman, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10044/">Lady Denham</a>, and his hunting three times a week) was just come in from hunting. So I stood and saw him dress himself, and try on his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10449/">vest</a>, which is <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> new fashion, and will be in it for good and all on Monday next, and the whole Court: it is a fashion, the King says; he will never change. He being ready, he and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a>, Lord Bellasses, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a>, and myself, met at a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee for Tangier</a>. My Lord Bellasses&#8217;s propositions were read and discoursed of, about reducing the garrison to less charge; and indeed I am mad in love with my Lord Chancellor, for he do comprehend and speak out well, and with the greatest easinesse and authority that ever I saw man in my life. I did never observe how much easier a man do speak when he knows all the company to be below him, than in him; for though he spoke, indeed, excellent welt, yet his manner and freedom of doing it, as if he played with it, and was informing only all the rest of the company, was mighty pretty. He did call again and again upon Mr. Povy for his accounts. I did think fit to make the solemn tender of my accounts that I intended. I said something that was liked, touching the want of money, and the bad credit of our tallys. My Lord Chancellor moved, that without any trouble to any of the rest of the Lords, I might alone attend the King, when he was with his private Council; and open the state of the garrison&#8217;s want of credit; and all that could be done, should. Most things moved were referred to Committees, and so we broke up. And at the end <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> come; so I away with him, and he discoursed with me something of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament&#8217;s</a> business. They have voted giving the [King] for next year 1,800,000<i>l.</i>; which, were it not for his debts, were a great sum. He says, he thinks the House may say no more to us for the present, but that we must mend our manners against the next tryall, and mend them we will. But he thinks it not a fit time to be found making of trouble among ourselves, meaning about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, who most certainly must be removed, or made a Commissioner, and somebody else Comptroller. But he tells me that the House has a great envy at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and that had he ever thought fit in all his discourse to have touched upon the point of our want of money and badness of payment, it would have been laid hold on to Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s hurt; but he hath avoided it, though without much reason for it, most studiously, and in short did end thus, that he has never shewn so much of the pigeon in all his life as in his innocence to Sir G. Carteret at this time; which I believe, and will desire Sir G. Carteret to thank him for it. So we broke up and I by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, calling for a new pair of shoes, and so, little being to do at the office, did go home, and after spending a little in righting some of my books, which stood out of order, I to bed.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Lay long in bed, among other things, talking of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> renewing her acquaintance with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce</a>, which, by my wife&#8217;s ill using her when she was here last, hath been interrupted. Herein we were a little angry together, but presently friends again; and so up, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, which was mighty full, and my beauties, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9470/">Mrs. Lethulier</a> and fair <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8438/">Batelier</a>, both there. A very foul morning, and rained; and sent for my cloake to go out of the church with. So dined, and after dinner (a good discourse thereat to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>) he and I by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and he to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1012/">Westminster Abbey</a>. Here I met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/848/">Sir Stephen Fox</a>, who told me how much right I had done myself, and how well it is represented by the Committee to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a>, my readinesse to give them satisfaction in everything when they were at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. I was glad of this. He did further discourse of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a>, great abilities, and how necessary it were that I were of the House to assist him. I did not owne it, but do myself think it were not unnecessary if either he should die, or be removed to the Lords, or any thing to hinder his doing the like service the next trial, which makes me think that it were not a thing very unfit; but I will not move in it. He and I parted, I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin&#8217;s</a>, thinking to have met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8607/">Mrs. Burrows</a>, but she was not there, so away and took my brother out of the Abbey and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there to set some accounts right, and to the office to even my Journall, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Called up, though a very rainy morning, by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmley</a>, and he and I most of the morning together evening of accounts, which I was very glad of. Then he and I out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir Robt. Viner&#8217;s</a>, at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7006/">African house</a> (where I had not been since he come thither); but he was not there; but I did some business with his people, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8583/">Colvill&#8217;s</a>, who, I find, lives now in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1499/">Lyme Streete</a>, and with the same credit as ever, this <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">fire</a> having not done them any wrong that I hear of at all. Thence he and I together to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, in our way talking of matters and passages of state, the viciousness of the Court; the contempt <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> brings himself into thereby; his minding nothing, but doing all things just as his people about him will have it; the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> becoming a slave to this whore <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10044/">Denham</a>, and wholly minds her; that there really was amours between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1402/">the Duchesse</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9424/">Sidney</a>; a that there is reason to fear that, as soon as the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> have raised this money, the King will see that he hath got all that he can get, and then make up a peace. He tells me, what I wonder at, but that I find it confirmed by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Mr. Pierce</a>, whom I met by-and-by in the Hall, that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> is of the caball with the Duke of York, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Bruncker</a>, with this Denham; which is a shame, and I am sorry for it, and that Sir W. Coventry do make her visits; but yet I hope it is not so. Pierce tells me, that as little agreement as there is between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">the Prince</a> &#8212;[Rupert]&#8212; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, yet they are likely to go to sea again; for the first will not be trusted alone, and nobody will go with him but this Duke of Albemarle. He tells me much how all the commanders of the fleete and officers that are sober men do cry out upon their bad discipline, and the ruine that must follow it if it continue. But that which I wonder most at, it seems their secretaries have been the most exorbitant in their fees to all sorts of the people, that it is not to be believed that they durst do it, so as it is believed they have got 800<i>l.</i> apiece by the very vacancies in the fleete. He tells me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne</a> is concluded to be with child again; and that all the people about the King do make no scruple of saying that the King do lie with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a>, who, he says, is a most excellent-natured lady. This day the King begins to put on his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10449/">vest</a>, and I did see several persons of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/293/">House of Lords</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">Commons</a> too, great courtiers, who are in it; being a long cassocke close to the body, of black cloth, and pinked with white silke under it, and a coat over it, and the legs ruffled with black riband like a pigeon&#8217;s leg; and, upon the whole, I wish the King may keep it, for it is a very fine and handsome garment.<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-15"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-15">1</a></sup> Walking with Pierce in the Court of Wards out comes Sir W. Coventry, and he and I talked of business. Among others I proposed the making <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> a Commissioner, and make somebody else <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/485/">Comptroller</a>. He tells me it is the thing he hath been thinking of, and hath spoke to the Duke of York of it. He believes it will be done; but that which I fear is that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Pen</a> will be Comptroller, which I shall grudge a little. The <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a> called him aside and spoke a good while with him. I did presently fear it might be to discourse something of his design to blemish my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord of Sandwich</a>, in pursuance of the wild motion he made the other day in the House. Sir W. Coventry, when he come to me again, told me that he had wrought a miracle, which was, the convincing the Duke of Buckingham that something &#8212; he did not name what &#8212; that he had intended to do was not fit to be done, and that the Duke is gone away of that opinion. This makes me verily believe it was something like what I feared.</p>

<p>By and by the House rose, and then we parted, and I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and walked in the Exchequer Court, discoursing of businesses. Among others, I observing to him how friendly Sir W. Coventry had carried himself to him in these late inquiries, when, if he had borne him any spleen, he could have had what occasion he pleased offered him, he did confess he found the same thing, and would thanke him for it.</p>

<p>I did give him some other advices, and so away with him to his lodgings at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to dinner, where my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/">Lady Carteret</a> is, and mighty kind, both of them, to me. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8250/">Their son</a> and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/">Lady Jemimah</a> will be here very speedily. She tells me the ladies are to go into a new fashion shortly, and that is, to wear short coats, above their ancles; which she and I do not like, but conclude this long trayne to be mighty graceful. But she cries out of the vices of the Court, and how they are going to set up plays already; and how, the next day after the late great fast, the Duchesse of York did give the King and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">Queene</a> a play. Nay, she told me that they have heretofore had plays at Court the very nights before the fast for the death of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/624/">late King</a>: She do much cry out upon these things, and that which she believes will undo the whole nation; and I fear so too.</p>

<p>After dinner away <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8801/">Mr. Brisband</a> along with me as far as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a>, and there looked upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10442/">a new booke</a>, set out by one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10441/">Rycault</a>, secretary to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/766/">Lord Winchelsea</a>, of the policy and customs of the Turks, which is, it seems, much cried up. But I could not stay, but home, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> come back, and with him some muster-books, which I am glad of, and hope he will do me credit in his employment. By and by took coach again and carried him home, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to her tailor&#8217;s, while I to White Hall to have found out <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a>, but miss him and so call in my wife and home again, where at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a> I met Sir W. Pen, lately come from the fleete at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8827/">the Nore</a>; and here were many good fellows, among others <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/930/">Sir R. Holmes</a>, who is exceeding kind to me, more than usual, which makes me afeard of him, though I do much wish his friendship. Thereupon, after a little stay, I withdrew, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and awhile, and then home to supper and to my chamber to settle a few papers, and then to bed.</p>

<p>This day the great debate was in Parliament, the manner of raising the 1,800,000<i>l.</i> they voted [the King] on Friday; and at last, after many proposals, one moved that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14058/">Chimney-money</a> might be taken from the King, and an equal revenue of something else might be found for the King, and people be enjoyned to buy off this tax of Chimney-money for ever at eight years&#8217; purchase, which will raise present money, as they think, 1,600,000<i>l.</i>, and the State be eased of an ill burthen and the King be supplied of something as food or better for his use. The House seems to like this, and put off the debate to to-morrow.</p>

In this month His Majestie and whole Court changed the fashion of their clothes-viz. a close coat of cloth, pinkt with a white taffety under the cutts. This in length reached the calf of the leg, and upon that a sercoat cutt at the breast, which hung loose and shorter than the vest six inches. The breeches the Spanish cut, and buskins some of cloth, some of leather, but of the same colour as the vest or garment; of never the like fashion since William the Conqueror.&#8221; It is represented in a portrait of Lord Arlington, by Sir P.

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where sat to do little business but hear clamours for money. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and to the office again, after hearing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> play a little upon the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1594/">Lyra viall</a>, which he do so as to show that he hath a love to musique and a spirit for it, which I am well pleased with.

		<p>Up, and busy about public and private business all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, alone with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, with whom I had now the first private talke I have had, and find he hath preached but twice in his life. I did give him some advice to study pronunciation; but I do fear he will never make a good speaker, nor, I fear, any general good scholar, for I do not see that he minds optickes or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/370/">mathematiques</a> of any sort, nor anything else that I can find. I know not what he may be at divinity and ordinary school-learning. However, he seems sober, and that pleases me. After dinner took him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">Barker</a> (for so is our new woman called, and is yet but a sorry girle), and set them down at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there find some of my brethren with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, but so few I put off the meeting. So staid and heard the Duke discourse, which he did mighty scurrilously, of the French, and with reason, that they should give <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10447/">Beaufort</a> orders when he was to bring, and did bring, his fleete hither, that his rendezvous for his fleete, and for all <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10448/">sluggs</a> to come to, should be between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/640/">Calais</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/646/">Dover</a>; which did prove the taking of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9997/">La Roche[lle]</a>, who, among other sluggs behind, did, by their instructions, make for that place, to rendezvous with the fleete; and Beaufort, seeing them as he was returning, took them for the English fleete, and wrote word to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> that he had passed by the English fleete, and the English fleete durst not meddle with him.</p>

<p>The Court is all full of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10449/">vests</a>, only my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1618/">Lord St. Albans</a> not pinked but plain black; and they say the King says the pinking upon white makes them look too much like magpyes, and therefore hath bespoke one of plain velvet. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a> by coach, and spoke, at four o&#8217;clock or five, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, newly come from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a>, where they have sat all this day and not come to an end of the debate how the money shall be raised. He tells me that what I proposed to him the other day was what he had himself thought on and determined, and that he believes it will speedily be done &#8212; the making <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/920/">Commissioner</a>, and bringing somebody else to be <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/485/">Comptroller</a>, and that (which do not please me, I confess, for my own particulars, so well as Sir J. Minnes) will, I fear, be <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, for he is the only fit man for it.</p>

<p>Away from him and took up my wife, and left her at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/276/">Temple Bar</a> to buy some lace for a petticoat, and I took coach and away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir R. Viner&#8217;s</a> about a little business, and then home, and by and by to my chamber, and there late upon making up an account for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/">the Board</a> to pass to-morrow, if I can get them, for the clearing all my imprest bills, which if I can do, will be to my very good satisfaction. Having done this, then to supper and to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning. The waters so high in the roads, by the late rains, that our letters come not in till to-day, and now I understand that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> is got well home, but had a painful journey of it.</p>

<p>At noon with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10450/">St. Ellen&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10451/">the master</a> of the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9544/">Pope&#8217;s Head Taverne</a> is now set up again, and there dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren&#8217;s</a> cost, a very good dinner. Here my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> proffered to carry me and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> into a play at Court to-night, and to lend me his coach home, which tempted me much; but I shall not do it. Thence rose from table before dinner ended, and homewards met my wife, and so away by coach towards <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Lovett&#8217;s</a> (in the way wondering at what a good pretty wench our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">Barker</a> makes, being now put into good clothes, and fashionable, at my charge; but it becomes her, so that I do not now think much of it, and is an example of the power of good clothes and dress), where I stood godfather. But it was pretty, that, being a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7980/">Protestant</a>, a man stood by and was my Proxy to answer for me. A priest christened it, and the boy&#8217;s name is Samuel. The ceremonies many, and some foolish. The priest in a gentleman&#8217;s dress, more than my owne; but is a Capuchin, one of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/">Queene-mother&#8217;s</a> priests. He did give my proxy and the woman proxy (my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10452/">Lady Bills</a>, absent, had a proxy also) good advice to bring up the child, and, at the end, that he ought never to marry the child nor the godmother, nor the godmother the child or the godfather: but, which is strange, they say that the mother of the child and the godfather may marry. By and by the Lady Bills come in, a well-bred but crooked woman. The poor people of the house had good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>, and a good <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/395/">cake</a>; and she a pretty woman in her lying-in dress. It cost me near 40<i>s.</i> the whole christening: to midwife 20<i>s.</i>, nurse 10<i>s.</i>, mayde 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the coach 5<i>s.</i> I was very well satisfied with what I have done, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to the office, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, and there hear how the business of buying off the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14058/">Chimney-money</a> is passed in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a>; and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> to be satisfied some other way, and the King supplied with the money raised by this purchasing off of the chimnies. So home, mightily pleased in mind that I have got my bills of imprest cleared by bills signed this day, to my good satisfaction. To supper, and to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and by coach to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly&#8217;s</a>, and thence (he being gone out), to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a> chamber, and there find him and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a> about my Lord Bellasses&#8217; accounts, which was the business I went upon. This was soon ended, and then I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> back home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">my house</a>, and there he and I did even accounts for salary, and by that time dinner was ready, and merry at dinner, and then abroad to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy&#8217;s</a>, who continues as much confounded in all his business as ever he was; and would have had me paid money, as like a fool as himself, which I troubled him in refusing; but I did persist in it. After a little more discourse, I left them, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where I met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir Robert Viner</a>, who told me a little of what, in going home, I had seen; also a little of the disorder and mutiny among the seamen at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11011/">Treasurer&#8217;s office</a>, which did trouble me then and all day since, considering how many more seamen will come to towne every day, and no money for them. A <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> sitting, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a> close by, and an enemy to hear of, and laugh at it.<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-19"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-19">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Viner too, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/967/">Backewell</a>, were sent for this afternoon; and was before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and his Cabinet about money; they declaring they would advance no more, it being discoursed of in the House of Parliament for the King to issue out his privy-seals to them to command them to trust him, which gives them reason to decline trusting. But more money they are persuaded to lend, but so little that (with horrour I speake it), coming after the Council was up, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, and myself, I did lay the state of our condition before the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, that the fleete could not go out without several things it wanted, and we could not have without money, particularly <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10453/">rum</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/394/">bread</a>, which we have promised the man <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10454/">Swan</a> to helpe him to 200<i>l.</i> of his debt, and a few other small sums of 200<i>l.</i> a piece to some others, and that I do foresee the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> would call us to an account why the fleete is not abroad, and we cannot answer otherwise than our want of money; and that indeed we do not do the King any service now, but do rather abuse and betray his service by being there, and seeming to do something, while we do not. Sir G. Carteret asked me (just in these words, for in this and all the rest I set down the very words for memory sake, if there should be occasion) whether 50<i>l.</i> or 60<i>l.</i> would do us any good; and when I told him the very rum man must have 200<i>l.</i>, he held up his eyes as if we had asked a million. Sir W. Coventry told the Duke of York plainly he did rather desire to have his commission called in than serve in so ill a place, where he cannot do the King service, and I did concur in saying the same. This was all very plain, and the Duke of York did confess that he did not see how we could do anything without a present supply of 20,000<i>l.</i>, and that he would speak to the King next Council day, and I promised to wait on him to put him in mind of it. This I set down for my future justification, if need be, and so we broke up, and all parted, Sir W. Coventry being not very well, but I believe made much worse by this night&#8217;s sad discourse.</p>

<p>So I home by coach, considering what the consequence of all this must be in a little time. Nothing but distraction and confusion; which makes me wish with all my heart that I were well and quietly settled with what little I have got at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6602/">Brampton</a>, where I might live peaceably, and study, and pray for the good of the King and my country.</p>

<p>Home, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, where I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">my Lady</a>, who is now come down stairs after a great sickness. Sir W. Batten was at the pay to-day, and tells me how rude the men were, but did go away quietly, being promised pay on Wednesday next. God send us money for it!</p>

<p>Among other things proposed in the House to-day, to give the King in lieu of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14058/">chimneys</a>, there was the bringing up of sealed paper, such as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J.

				<a href="/diary/1666/10/20/">Saturday 20 October 1666</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where none met but myself. So I walked a good while with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gawden</a> in the garden, who is lately come from the fleete at the buoy of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8827/">the Nore</a>, and he do tell me how all the sober commanders, and even <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1204/">Sir Thomas Allen</a> himself, do complain of the ill government of the fleete. How <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/930/">Holmes</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10026/">Jennings</a> have commanded all the fleete this yeare, that nothing is done upon deliberation, but if a sober man give his opinion otherwise than <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">the Prince</a> would have it the Prince would cry, &#8220;Damn him, do you follow your orders, and that is enough for you.&#8221; He tells me he hears of nothing but of swearing and drinking and whoring, and all manner of profaneness, quite through the whole fleete.</p>

<p>He being gone, there comes to me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7120/">Commissioner Middleton</a>, whom I took on purpose to walk in the garden with me, and to learn what he observed when the fleete was at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>. He says that the fleete was in such a condition, as to discipline, as if the Devil had commanded it; so much wickedness of all sorts.</p>

<p>Enquiring how it come to pass that so many ships miscarried this year, he tells me that he enquired; and the pilots do say, that they dare not do nor go but as the Captains will have them; and if they offer to do otherwise, the Captains swear they will run them through.</p>

<p>He says that he heard <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10455/">Captain Digby</a> (my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2845/">Lord of Bristoll&#8217;s</a> son, a young fellow that never was but one year, if that, in the fleete) say that he did hope he should not see a tarpaulin have the command of a ship within this twelve months.</p>

<p>He observed while he was on board the Admirall, when the fleete was at Portsmouth, that there was a faction there. Holmes commanded all on the Prince&#8217;s side, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6415/">Sir Jeremy Smith</a> on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">the Duke&#8217;s</a>, and every body that come did apply themselves to one side or other; and when the Duke of Albemarle was gone away to come hither, then Sir Jeremy Smith did hang his head, and walked in the Generall&#8217;s ship but like a private commander.</p>

<p>He says he was on board <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2462/">The Prince</a>, when the newes come of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the burning</a> of London; and all the Prince said was, that now <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10456/">Shipton&#8217;s</a> prophecy was out; and he heard a young commander presently swear, that now a citizen&#8217;s wife that would not take under half a piece before, would be occupied for half-a-crowne: and made mighty sport of it.</p>

<p>He says that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10457/">Hubberd</a> that commanded this year the Admiral&#8217;s ship is a proud conceited fellow (though I thought otherwise of him), and fit to command a single ship but not a fleete, and he do wonder that there hath not been more mischief this year than there hath. He says the fleete come to anchor between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10458/">the Horse</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6947/">the Island</a>, so that when they came to weigh many of the ships could not turn, but run foul of the Horse, and there stuck, but that the weather was good.</p>

<p>He says that nothing can do <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> more disservice, nor please the standing officers of the ship better than these silly commanders that now we have, for they sign to anything that their officers desire of them, nor have judgment to contradict them if they would.</p>

<p>He told me other good things, which made me bless God that we have received no greater disasters this year than we have, though they have been the greatest that ever was known in England before, put all their losses of the King&#8217;s ships by want of skill and seamanship together from the beginning.</p>

<p>He being gone, comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and he and I walked together awhile, discoursing upon the sad condition of the times, what need we have, and how impossible it is to get money.</p>

<p>He told me my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> the other day did ask him how it come to pass that his friend Pepys do so much magnify all things to worst, as I did on Sunday last, in the bad condition of the fleete. Sir G. Carteret tells me that he answered him, that I was but the mouth of the rest, and spoke what they have dictated to me; which did, as he says, presently take off his displeasure. So that I am well at present with him, but I must have a care not to be over busy in the office again, and burn my fingers.</p>

<p>He tells me he wishes he had sold his place at some good rate to somebody or other at the beginning of the warr, and that he would do it now, but no body will deale with him for it.</p>

<p>He tells me the Duke of Albemarle is very much discontented, and the Duke of York do not, it seems, please him.</p>

<p>He tells me that our case as to money is not to be made good at present, and therefore wishes a good and speedy peace before it be too late, and from his discourse methinks I find that there is something moving towards it.</p>

<p>Many people at the office, but having no more of the office I did put it off till the next meeting.</p>

<p>Thence, with Sir G. Carteret, home to dinner, with him, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/">my Lady</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9422/">Mr. Ashburnham</a>, the Cofferer. Here they talk that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">the Queene</a> hath a great mind to alter her fashion, and to have the feet seen, which she loves mightily; and they do believe that it [will] come into it in a little time.</p>

<p>Here I met with the King&#8217;s declaration about his proceedings with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8841/">King of Denmarke</a>, and particularly the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8832/">Bergen</a>; but it is so well writ, that, if it be true, the King of Denmarke is one of the most absolute wickednesse in the world for a person of his quality.</p>

<p>After dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a> by appointment, and there he and I all the afternoon, till late at night, evening of all accounts between us, which we did to both our satisfaction; but that which troubles me most is, that I am to refund to the ignoble <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/">Lord Peterborough</a> what he had given us six months ago, because we did not supply him with money; but it is no great matter.</p>

<p>He gone I to the office, and there did some business; and so home, my mind in good ease by having done with Povy in order to the adjusting of all my accounts in a few days. So home to supper and to bed.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1666/10/21/">Sunday 21 October 1666</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, and her new woman <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">Barker</a> with her the first time. The girle will, I think, do very well.</p>

<p>Here a lazy sermon, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and took in my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">Peg</a> (<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir William</a> being below with the fleete), and mighty merry we were, and then after dinner presently (it being a mighty cool day) I by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there attended the Cabinet, and was called in before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and them to give an account of our want of money for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, which troubles me that it should be my place so often and so soon after one another to come to speak there of their wants &#8212; the thing of the world that they love least to hear of, and that which is no welcome thing to be the solicitor for &#8212; and to see how like an image the King sat and could not speak one word when I had delivered myself was very strange; only my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> did ask me, whether I thought it was in nature at this time to help us to anything. So I was referred to another meeting of the Lords Commissioners for Tangier and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a>, and so went away, and by coach home, where I spent the evening in reading <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8459/">Stillingfleet&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10460/">defence</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10461/">the Archbishopp</a>, the part about Purgatory, a point I had never considered before, what was said for it or against it, and though I do believe we are in the right, yet I do not see any great matter in this book.</p>

<p>So to supper; and my people being gone, most of them, to bed, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a> and I did get two of my iron chests out of the cellar into my closett, and the money to my great satisfaction to see it there again, and the rather because the damp cellar spoils all my chests. This being done, and I weary, to bed.</p>

<p>This afternoon walking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a> long in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6451/">the gallery</a>, he told me, among many other things, how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5540/">Harry Killigrew</a> is banished the Court lately, for saying that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne</a> was a little lecherous girle when she was young &#8230; This she complained to the King of, and he sent to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, whose servant he is, to turn him away. The Duke of York hath done it, but takes it ill of my Lady that he was not complained to first. She attended him to excute it, but ill blood is made by it.</p>

<p>He told me how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5908/">Mr. Williamson</a> stood in a little place to have come into the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">House of Commons</a>, and they would not choose him; they said, &#8220;No courtier.&#8221; And which is worse, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8631/">Bab May</a> went down in great state to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14079/">Winchelsea</a> with the Duke of York&#8217;s letters, not doubting to be chosen; and there the people chose a private gentleman in spite of him, and cried out they would have no Court pimp to be their burgesse; which are things that bode very ill. This afternoon I went to see and sat a good while with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin</a>, and there was her sister <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10215/">Doll</a>, with whom, contrary to all expectation, I did what I would, and might have done anything else.</p>

		<p>Up, and by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, there thinking to have met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Michell</a>, who I heard yesterday staid all night at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6514/">her father&#8217;s</a>, but she was gone. So I staid a little and then down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">the bridge</a> by water, and there overtook her and her father. So saluted her and walked over London Bridge with them and there parted, the weather being very foul, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a> by water, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8104/">Mr. Caesar</a> playing the treble to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a> upon the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/457/">Theorbo</a>, the first time I heard him, which pleases me mightily. After dinner I carried him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> towards Westminster, by coach, myself &#8217;lighting at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a>, and there, being a little too soon, walked in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1343/">Temple Church</a>, looking with pleasure on the monuments and epitaphs, and then to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Belasses</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a> by appointment met to discourse of some of their <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> accounts between my Lord and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7263/">Vernatty</a>, who will prove a very knave. That being done I away with Povy to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and thence I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>, and there take up my wife, and so home, it being very foule and darke. Being there come, I to the settling of some of my money matters in my chests, and evening some accounts, which I was at late, to my extraordinary content, and especially to see all things hit so even and right and with an apparent profit and advantage since my last accounting, but how much I cannot particularly yet come to adjudge.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W.

		<p>Up, and down to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>, and there find little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell</a> come to his new shop that he hath built there in the room of his house that was burned. I hope he will do good here. I drank and bade him joy, for I love him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">his wife</a> well, him for his care, and her for her person, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where we attended <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>; and to all our complaints for want of money, which now we are tired out with making, the Duke only tells us that he is sorry for it, and hath spoke to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> of it, and money we shall have as soon as it can be found; and though all the issue of the war lies upon it, yet that is all the answer we can get, and that is as bad or worse than nothing. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, where the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14059/">term</a> is begun, and I did take a turn or two, and so away by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir R. Viner&#8217;s</a>, and there received some money, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to dinner. After dinner to little business, and then abroad with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, she to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">her brother</a>, who is sick, and she believes is from some discontent <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">his wife</a> hath given him by her loose carriage, which he is told, and he hath found has been very suspicious in his absence, which I am sorry for. I to the Hall and there walked long, among others talking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9835/">Mr. Hayes</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert&#8217;s</a> Secretary, a very ingenious man, and one, I think, fit to contract some friendship with. Here I staid late, walking to and again, hearing how the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> proceeds, which is mighty slowly in the settling of the money business, and great factions growing every day among them.</p>

<p>I am told also how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/930/">Holmes</a> did last Sunday deliver in his articles to the King and Cabinet against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6415/">[Sir Jeremy] Smith</a>, and that Smith hath given in his answer, and lays his not accompanying the fleete to his pilot, who would not undertake to carry the ship further; which the pilot acknowledges. The thing is not accommodated, but only taken up, and both sides commanded to be quiet; but no peace like to be. The <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> is Smith&#8217;s friend, and hath publiquely swore that he would never go to sea again unless Holmes&#8217;s commission were taken from him.<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-24"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-24">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I find by Hayes that they did expect great glory in coming home in so good condition as they did with the fleete, and therefore I the less wonder that the Prince was distasted with my discourse the other day about the bad state of the fleete. But it pleases me to hear that he did expect great thanks, and lays the fault of the want of it upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a>, which deadened everything, and the glory of his services.</p>

<p>About seven at night home, and called my wife, and, it being moonshine, took her into the garden, and there layed open our condition as to our estate, and the danger of my having it [his money] all in the house at once, in case of any disorder or troubles in the State, and therefore resolved to remove part of it to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a>, and part some whither else, and part in my owne house, which is very necessary, and will tend to our safety, though I shall not think it safe out of my owne sight.</p>

<p>So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

	<li id="fn1-1666-10-24">In the instructions given to Sir Thomas Clifford (August 5th, 1666) to be communicated to Prince Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle, we read: &#8220;to tell them that the complaint of Sir Jeremy Smith&#8217;s misbehaviour in the late engagement being so universal, unless he have fully satisfied the generals he should be brought to trial by court-martial, and there purged or condemned.&#8221; The Duke of Albemarle answered the king (August 14th?): &#8220;Wishes to clear a gallant man falsely accused, Sir Jeremiah Smith, who had more men killed and hurt, and his ship received more shot than any in the fleet. There is not a more spirited man serves in the fleet&#8221; On October 27th H. Muddiman wrote to Sir Edward Stradling: &#8220;Sir Jeremy Smith has got as much credit by his late examination as his enemies wished him disgrace, the King and Duke of York being fully satisfied of his valour in the engagement. It appears that he had 147 men killed and wounded, while the most eminent of his accusers had but two or three.&#8221; With regard to Sir Jeremy&#8217;s counter-charges, we read: &#8220;Nov. 3. The King having maturely considered the charges brought against Sir Rob. Holmes by Sir Jeremy Smith, finds no cause to suspect Sir Robert of cowardice in the fight with the Dutch of June 25 and 26, but thinks that on the night of the 26th he yielded too easily to the opinion of his pilot, without consulting those of the other ships, muzzled his ship, and thus obliged the squadron to do the same, and so the enemy, which might have been driven into the body of the king&#8217;s fleet, then returning from the pursuit, was allowed to escape&#8221; (&#8221; Calendar of State Papers,&#8221; 1666-67, pp. 14, 40, 222, 236). <a href="#fnr1-1666-10-24">&#8617;</a></li>

		<p>Up betimes and by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, who is come to his winter lodgings at White Hall, and there agreed upon a method of paying of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">tickets</a>; and so I back again <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning, but to little purpose but to receive clamours for money. At noon home to dinner, where the two <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9099/">Mrs. Daniels</a> come to see us, and dined with us. After dinner I out with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierces</a>, where she hath not been a great while, from some little unkindness of my wife&#8217;s to her when she was last here, but she received us with mighty respect and discretion, and was making herself mighty fine to go to a great ball to-night at Court, being <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">the Queene&#8217;s</a> birthday; so the ladies for this one day do wear laces, but to put them off again to-morrow. Thence I to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker&#8217;s</a>, and with him to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Mrs. Williams&#8217;s</a> where we met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a>. I was glad to see the jade. Made her sing; and she told us they begin at both houses to act on Monday next. But I fear, after all this sorrow, their gains will be but little. Mrs. Williams says, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2935/">Duke&#8217;s house</a> will now be much the better of the two, because of their women; which I am glad to hear.</p>

<p>Thence with Lord Bruncker to White Hall and there spoke with Sir W. Coventry about some office business, and then I away to Mrs. Pierces, and there saw her new closet, which is mighty rich and fine. Her daughter <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9044/">Betty</a> grows mighty pretty.</p>

<p>Thence with my wife home and to do business at the office. Then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, who tells me that the House of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> makes mighty little haste in settling the money, and that he knows not when it will be done; but they fall into faction, and libells have been found in the House. Among others, one yesterday, wherein they reckon up divers great sums to be given away by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, among others, 10,000<i>l.</i> to Sir W. Coventry, for weare and teare (the point he stood upon to advance that sum by, for them to give the King); Sir G. Carteret 50,000<i>l.</i> for something else, I think supernumerarys; and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8019/">Matt. Wren</a> 5000<i>l.</i> for passing the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10425/">Canary Company&#8217;s</a> patent; and so a great many other sums to other persons.</p>

<p>So home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and all the morning and most of the afternoon within doors, beginning to set my accounts in order from before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">this fire</a>, I being behindhand with them ever since; and this day I got most of my tradesmen to bring in their bills and paid them. Dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and busy again after dinner, and then abroad by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, where I walked till the evening, and then out, the first time I ever was abroad with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10215/">Doll Lane</a>, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/400/">Dog tavern</a>, and there drank with her, a bad face, but good bodied girle. Did nothing but salute and play with her and talk, and thence away by coach, home, and so to do a little more in my accounts, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>Nothing done in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a> yet as to the finishing of the bill for money, which is a mighty sad thing, all lying at stake for it.</p>

		<p>Up, and there comes to see me my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Belasses</a>, which was a great honour. He tells me great newes, yet but what I suspected, that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7263/">Vernatty</a> is fled, and so hath cheated him and twenty more, but most of all, I doubt, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>.</p>

<p>Thence to talk about publique business; he tells me how the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">two</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/293/">Houses</a> begin to be troublesome; the Lords to have quarrels one with another. My Lord <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a> having said to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> (who is against the passing of the Bill for prohibiting the bringing over of Irish cattle), that whoever was against the Bill, was there led to it by an Irish interest, or an Irish understanding, which is as much as to say he is a Foole; this bred heat from my Lord Chancellor, and something he [Buckingham] said did offend my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5825/">Lord of Ossory</a> (my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1221/">Lord Duke&#8217; of Ormond&#8217;s</a> son), and they two had hard words, upon which the latter sends a challenge to the former; of which the former complains to the House, and so the business is to be heard on Monday next.</p>

<p>Then as to the Commons; some ugly knives, like poignards, to stab people with, about two or three hundred of them were brought in yesterday to the House, found in one of the house&#8217;s rubbish that was burned, and said to be the house of a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/306/">Catholique</a>. This and several letters out of the country, saying how high the Catholiques are everywhere and bold in the owning their religion, have made the Commons mad, and they presently voted that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> be desired to put all Catholiques out of employment, and other high things; while the business of money hangs in the hedge. So that upon the whole, God knows we are in a sad condition like to be, there being the very beginnings of the late troubles. He gone, I at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9472/">her boy</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a>, who sings as well, and is the best company in the world, dined with us, and infinite merry. The playhouses begin to play next week.</p>

<p>Towards evening I took them out to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, and there <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> bought things, and I did give each of them a pair of Jesimy<sup id="fnr1-1666-10-27"><a href="#fn1-1666-10-27">1</a></sup> plain <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a>, and another of white. Here Knipp and I walked up and down to see handsome faces, and did see several. Then carried each of them home, and with great pleasure and content, home myself, where, having writ several letters, I home, and there, upon some serious discourse between my wife and I upon the business, I called to us <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, and there broke to him our design to send him into the country with some part of our money, and so did seriously discourse the whole thing, and then away to supper and to bed. I pray God give a blessing to our resolution, for I do much fear we shall meet with speedy distractions for want of money.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1666/10/28/">Sunday 28 October 1666</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there is come little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">his wife</a>, I sent for them, and also comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/606/">Captain Guy</a> to dine with me, and he and I much talk together. He cries out of the discipline of the fleete, and confesses really that the true English valour we talk of is almost spent and worn out; few of the commanders doing what they should do, and he much fears we shall therefore be beaten the next year. He assures me we were beaten home the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10035/">last June fight</a>, and that the whole fleete was ashamed to hear of our bonefires. He commends <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6415/">Smith</a>, and cries out of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/930/">Holmes</a> for an idle, proud, conceited, though stout fellow. He tells me we are to owe the losse of so many ships on the sands, not to any fault of the pilots, but to the weather; but in this I have good authority to fear there was something more. He says the Dutch do fight in very good order, and we in none at all. He says that in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10467/">the July fight</a>, both <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">the Prince</a> and Holmes had their belly-fulls, and were fain to go aside; though, if the wind had continued, we had utterly beaten them. He do confess the whole to be governed by a company of fools, and fears our ruine.</p>

<p>After dinner he gone, I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> and he to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1012/">Westminster Abbey</a>. I presently to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin&#8217;s</a>, and there met widow <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8607/">Burroughes</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10215/">Doll</a>, and did tumble them all the afternoon as I pleased, and having given them a bottle of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> I parted and home by boat (my brother going by land), and thence with my wife to sit and sup with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/911/">uncle</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/995/">aunt Wight</a>, and see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10468/">Woolly&#8217;s wife</a>, who is a pretty woman, and after supper, being very merry, in abusing my aunt with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8087/">Dr. Venner</a>, we home, and I to do something in my accounts, and so to bed.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10469/">Revenge</a> having her forecastle blown up with powder to the killing of some men in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a>, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8476/">Dyamond&#8217;s</a> being overset in the careening at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/">Sheernesse</a>, are further marks of the method all <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> work is now done in. The <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5143/">Foresight</a> also and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10036/">another</a> come to disasters in the same place this week in the cleaning; which is strange.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> to do business, and thither comes to me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/659/">Sir Thomas Teddiman</a>, and he and I walked a good while in the garden together, discoursing of the disorder and discipline of the fleete, wherein he told me how bad every thing is; but was very wary in speaking any thing to the dishonour of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">the Prince</a> or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, but do magnify my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> much before them both, for ability to serve <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, and do heartily wish for him here. For he fears that we shall be undone the next year, but that he will, however, see an end of it.</p>

<p>To prevent the necessity of his dining with me I was forced to pretend occasion of going to Westminster, so away I went, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10485/">Mr. Barber</a>, the clerk, having a request to make to me to get him into employment, did walk along with me, and by water to Westminster with me, he professing great love to me, and an able clerk he is. When I come thither I find the new <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1522/">Lord Mayor</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10486/">Bolton</a> a-swearing at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/290/">the Exchequer</a>, with some of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4912/">Aldermen</a> and Livery; but, Lord! to see how meanely they now look, who upon this day used to be all little lords, is a sad sight and worthy consideration. And every body did reflect with pity upon the poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">City</a>, to which they are now coming to choose and swear their Lord Mayor, compared with what it heretofore was.</p>

<p>Thence by coach (having in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">the Hall</a> bought me a velvet riding cap, cost me 20<i>s.</i>) to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9587/">my taylor&#8217;s</a>, and there bespoke a plain <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10449/">vest</a>, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9584/">my goldsmith</a> to bid him look out for some gold for me; and he tells me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10487/">ginnys</a>, which I bought 2,000 of not long ago, and cost me but 18 1/2<i>d.</i> change, will now cost me 22<i>d.</i>; and but very few to be had at any price. However, some more I will have, for they are very convenient, and of easy disposal.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner and to discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> upon his translation of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6529/">Lord Bacon&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6530/">&#8220;Faber Fortunae,&#8221;</a> which I gave him to do and he has done it, but meanely; I am not pleased with it at all, having done it only literally, but without any life at all.</p>

<p>About five o&#8217;clock I took <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> (who is mighty fine, and with a new fair pair of locks, which vex me, though like a foole I helped her the other night to buy them), and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierces</a>, and there staying a little I away before to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8484/">the new playhouse</a> there, the first time I ever was there, and the first play I have seen since before the great <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">plague</a>. By and by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Mr. Pierce</a> comes, bringing my wife and his, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a>. By and by the King and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">Queene</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1402/">Duchesse</a>, and all the great ladies of the Court; which, indeed, was a fine sight. But the play being <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8183/">&#8220;Love in a Tub,&#8221;</a> a silly play, and though done by the Duke&#8217;s people, yet having neither <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2307/">Betterton</a> nor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4034/">his wife</a>, and the whole thing done ill, and being ill also, I had no manner of pleasure in the play. Besides, the House, though very fine, yet bad for the voice, for hearing. The sight of the ladies, indeed, was exceeding noble; and above all, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne</a>.</p>

<p>The play done by ten o&#8217;clock. I carried them all home, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> myself, and well satisfied with the sight, but not the play, we with great content to bed.</p>

At night home to supper, and singing with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, who hath lately begun to learn, and I think will come to do something, though her eare is not good, nor I, I confess, have patience enough to teach her, or hear her sing now and then a note out of tune, and am to blame that I cannot bear with that in her which is fit I should do with her as a learner, and one that I desire much could sing, and so should encourage her. This I was troubled at, for I do find that I do put her out of heart, and make her fearfull to sing before me.</p>

		<p>Out with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> toward <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, being in pain in my cods by being squeezed the other night in a little coach when I carried <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Pierce</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">his wife</a> and my people. But I hope I shall be soon well again. This day is a great day at the House, so little to do with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, but soon parted. Coming out of the Court I met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8320/">Colonell Atkins</a>, who tells me the whole city rings to-day of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6415/">Sir Jeremy Smith&#8217;s</a> killing of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/930/">Holmes</a> in a duell, at which I was not much displeased, for I fear every day more and more mischief from the man, if he lives; but the thing is not true, for in my coach I did by and by meet Sir Jer. Smith going to Court.</p>

<p>So I by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9584/">my goldsmith</a>, there to see what gold I can get, which is but little, and not under 22<i>d.</i> So away <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and after dinner to my closett, where I spent the whole afternoon till late at evening of all my accounts publique and private, and to my great satisfaction I do find that I do bring my accounts to a very near balance, notwithstanding all the hurries and troubles I have been put to by the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">fire</a>, that I have not been able to even my accounts since July last before; and I bless God I do find that I am worth more than ever I yet was, which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">is 6,200<i>l.</i></a>, for which the Holy Name of God be praised! and my other accounts of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> in a very plain and clear condition, that I am not liable to any trouble from them; but in fear great I am, and I perceive the whole city is, of some distractions and disorders among us, which God of his goodness prevent!</p>

<p>Late to supper with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">brother</a>, and then to bed.</p>

<p>And thus ends the month with an ill aspect, the business of the Navy standing wholly still. No credit, no goods sold us, nobody will trust. All we have to do at the office is to hear complaints for want of money. The Duke of York himself for now three weeks seems to rest satisfied that we can do nothing without money, and that all must stand still till <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> gets money, which the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> have been a great while about; but are so dissatisfied with the King&#8217;s management, and his giving himself up to pleasures, and not minding the calling to account any of his officers, and they observe so much the expense of the war, and yet that after we have made it the most we can, it do not amount to what they have given the King for the warn that they are backward of giving any more. However, 1,800,000<i>l.</i> they have voted, but the way of gathering it has taken up more time than is fit to be now lost: The seamen grow very rude, and every thing out of order; commanders having no power over their seamen, but the seamen do what they please. Few stay on board, but all coming running up hither to towne, and nobody can with justice blame them, we owing them so much money; and their familys must starve if we do not give them money, or they procure upon their <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">tickets</a> from some people that will trust them. A great folly is observed by all people in the King&#8217;s giving leave to so many merchantmen to go abroad this winter, and some upon voyages where it is impossible they should be back again by the spring, and the rest will be doubtfull, but yet we let them go; what the reason of State is nobody can tell, but all condemn it. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">The Prince</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> have got no great credit by this year&#8217;s service. Our losses both of reputation and ships having been greater than is thought have ever been suffered in all ages put together before; being beat home, and fleeing home the first fight, and then losing so many ships then and since upon the sands, and some falling into the enemy&#8217;s hands, and not one taken this yeare, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10489/">the Ruby</a>, French prize, now at the end of the yeare, by the Frenchmen&#8217;s mistake in running upon us.</p>

<p>Great folly in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">both</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/293/">Houses</a> of Parliament, several persons falling together by the eares, among others in the House of Lords, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a> and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5825/">Lord Ossory</a>. Such is our case, that every body fears an invasion the next yeare; and for my part, I do methinks foresee great unhappiness coming upon us, and do provide for it by laying by something against a rainy day, dividing what I have, and laying it in several places, but with all faithfulness to the King in all respects; my grief only being that the King do not look after his business himself, and thereby will be undone both himself and his nation, it being not yet, I believe, too late if he would apply himself to it, to save all, and conquer the Dutch; but while he and the Duke of York mind their pleasure, as they do and nothing else, we must be beaten.</p>

<p>So late with my mind in good condition of quiet after the settling all my accounts, and to bed.</p>
