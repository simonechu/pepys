				<a href="/diary/1664/07/01/">Friday 1 July 1664</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up and within all the morning, first bringing down my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1673/">Tryangle</a> to my chamber below, having a new frame made proper for it to stand on. By and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2633/">Dr. Burnett</a>, who assures me that I have an ulcer either in the kidneys or bladder, for my water, which he saw yesterday, he is sure the sediment is not slime gathered by heat, but is a direct pusse. He did write me down some direction what to do for it, but not with the satisfaction I expected.</p>

<p>Dr. Burnett&#8217;s advice to mee.</p>

<p>The Originall is fyled among my letters.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Take of ye Rootes of Marsh-Mallows foure ounces, of Cumfry, of Liquorish, of each two ounces, of ye Mowers of St. John&#8217;s Wort two Handsfull, of ye Leaves of Plantan, of Alehoofe, of each three handfulls, of Selfeheale, of Red Roses, of each one Handfull, of Cynament, of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/387/">Nutmegg</a>, of each halfe an ounce. Beate them well, then powre upon them one Quart of old Rhenish <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>, and about Six houres after strayne it and clarify it with ye white of an <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/390/">Egge</a>, and with a sufficient quantity of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/386/">sugar</a>, boyle it to ye consistence of a Syrrup and reserve it for use.</p>

	<p>Dissolve one spoonefull of this Syrrup in every draught of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/450/">Ale</a> or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/308/">beere</a> you drink.</p>

	<p>Morning and evening swallow ye quantity of an hazle-nutt of Cyprus Terebintine.</p>

	<p>If you are bound or have a fit of ye <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/346/">Stone</a> eate an ounce of Cassia new drawne, from ye poynt of a knife.</p>

	<p>Old Canary or Malaga wine you may drinke to three or 4 glasses, but noe new wine, and what wine you drinke, lett it bee at meales.</p>
</blockquote>
	
<p>&#8212;[From a slip of paper inserted in the Diary at this place.]&#8212;</p>

<p>I did give him a piece, with good hopes, however, that his advice will be of use to me, though it is strange that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1536/">Mr. Hollyard</a> should never say one word of this ulcer in all his life to me.</p>

<p>He being gone, I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, busy till the evening, and then by agreement came <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a> and one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7674/">Cheswicke</a>, a maister who plays very well upon the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2269/">Spinette</a>, and we sat singing Psalms till 9 at night, and so broke up with great pleasure, and very good company it is, and I hope I shall now and then have their company. They being gone, I to my office till towards twelve o&#8217;clock, and then home and to bed.</p>

<p>Upon the &#8217;Change, this day, I saw how uncertain the temper of the people is, that, from our discharging of about 200 that lay idle, having nothing to do, upon some of our ships, which were ordered to be fitted for service, and their works are now done, the towne do talk that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> discharges all his men, 200 yesterday and 800 to-day, and that now he hath got 100,000<i>l.</i> in his hand, he values not a Dutch warr. But I undeceived a great many, telling them how it is.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there, which is strange, I could meet with nobody that I could invite home to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/384/">venison pasty</a>, but only <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Mr. Alsopp</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Mr. Lanyon</a>, whom I invited last night, and a friend they brought along with them. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and with our venison pasty we had other good meat and good discourse. After dinner sat close to discourse about our business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> of the garrison of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, taking their prices of all provisions, and I do hope to order it so that they and I also may get something by it, which do much please me, for I hope I may get nobly and honestly with profit to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>. They being gone came <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, and he and I discoursed long about the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5619/">masts</a>, and then in the evening to my office, where late writing letters, and then home to look over some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a> papers, which I am under an oathe to dispatch before I spend one half houre in any pleasure or go to bed before 12 o&#8217;clock, to which, by the grace of God, I will be true. Then to bed.</p>

<p>When I came home I found that to-morrow being Sunday I should gain nothing by doing it to-night, and to-morrow I can do it very well and better than to-night. I went to bed before my time, but with a resolution of doing the thing to better purpose to-morrow.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up and ready, and all the morning in my chamber looking over and settling some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a> businesses. At noon to dinner, where the remains of yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/383/">venison</a> and a couple of brave green <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/379/">geese</a>, which we are fain to eat alone, because they will not keepe, which troubled us.</p>

<p>After dinner I close to my business, and before the evening did end it with great content, and my mind eased by it. Then up and spent the evening walking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> talking, and it thundering and lightning all the evening, and this yeare have had the most of thunder and lightning they say of any in man&#8217;s memory, and so it is, it seems, in France and everywhere else. So to prayers and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and many people with me about business, and then out to several places, and so at noon to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/105/">Lord Crew&#8217;s</a>, and there dined and very much made of there by him. He offered me the selling of some land of his in Cambridgeshire, a purchase of about 1000<i>l.</i>, and if I can compass it I will. After dinner I walked homeward, still doing business by the way, and at home find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> this day of her owne accord to have lain out 25<i>s.</i> upon a pair of pendantes for her eares, which did vex me and brought both me and her to very high and very foule words from her to me, such as trouble me to think she should have in her mouth, and reflecting upon our old differences, which I hate to have remembered. I vowed to breake them, or that she should go and get what she could for them again. I went with that resolution out of doors; the poor wretch afterwards in a little while did send out to change them for her money again. I followed <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6788/">Besse</a> her messenger at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there did consult and sent her back; I would not have them changed, being satisfied that she yielded. So went <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and friends again as to that business; but the words I could not get out of my mind, and so went to bed at night discontented, and she came to bed to me, but all would not make me friends, but sleep and rise in the morning angry.</p>

<p>This day <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">the Queene</a> went to visit my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> and the fleete, going forth in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7662/">the Hope</a>.<sup id="fnr1-1664-07-04"><a href="#fn1-1664-07-04">1</a></sup></p>

		<p>Up very betimes, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> also, and got us ready; and about eight o&#8217;clock, having got some bottles of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/308/">beer</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1662/">neat&#8217;s tongues</a>, we went to our barge at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Towre</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Mr. Pierce</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">his wife</a>, and a kinswoman and his sister, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1153/">Mrs. Clerke</a> and her sister and cozen were to expect us; and so set out for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7662/">the Hope</a>, all the way down playing at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/797/">cards</a> and other sports, spending our time pretty merry. Come to the Hope about one and there showed them all the ships, and had a collacion of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/376/">anchovies</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7695/">gammon</a>, &amp;c., and after an houre&#8217;s stay or more, embarked again for home; and so to cards and other sports till we came to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a>, and there Mrs. Clerke and my wife and I on shore to an alehouse, for them to do their business, and so to the barge again, having shown them <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2703/">pleasure boat</a>; and so home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">the Bridge</a>, bringing night home with us; and it rained hard, but we got them on foot to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1283/">the Beare</a>, and there put them into a boat, and I back to my wife in the barge, and so to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1349/">Tower Wharf</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, being very well pleased today with the company, especially Mrs. Pierce, who continues her complexion as well as ever, and hath, at this day, I think, the best complexion that ever I saw on any woman, young or old, or child either, all days of my life. Also Mrs. Clerke&#8217;s kinswoman sings very prettily, but is very confident in it; Mrs. Clerke herself witty, but spoils all in being so conceited and making so great a flutter with a few fine clothes and some bad tawdry things worne with them.</p>

<p>But the charge of the barge lies heavy upon me, which troubles me, but it is but once, and I may make Pierce do me some courtesy as great.</p>

<p>Being come home, I weary to bed with sitting. The reason of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/770/">Dr. Clerke&#8217;s</a> not being here was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> being sicke last night and let blood, and so he durst not come away to-day.</p>

		<p>Up, and this day begun, the first day this year, to put off my linnen waistcoat, but it happening to be a cool day I was afraid of taking cold, which troubles me, and is the greatest pain I have in the world to think of my bad temper of my health.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning. Dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, to my office to prepare some things against a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee of Tangier</a> this afternoon. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there found <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> and twenty more reading their commission (of which I am, and was also sent to, to come) for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">Royall Fishery</a>, which is very large, and a very serious charter it is; but the company generally so ill fitted for so serious a worke that I do much fear it will come to little.</p>

<p>That being done, and not being able to do any thing for lacke of an oathe for the Governor and Assistants to take, we rose.</p>

<p>Then our Committee for the Tangier <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> met and did a little, and so up, and I and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> walked in the garden half an hour, talking of the business of our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5619/">masts</a>, and thence away and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> walked half an hour or more in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Park</a>, and thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a> to drink some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/389/">creame</a>, but missed it and so parted, and I home, calling by the way for my new bookes, viz., <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7670/">Sir H. Spillman&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7671/">&#8220;Whole Glossary,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7697/">&#8220;Scapula&#8217;s Lexicon,&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7698/">Shakespeare&#8217;s plays</a>, which I have got money out of my stationer&#8217;s bills to pay for. So home and to my office a while, and then home and to bed, finding myself pretty well for all my waistecoate being put off to-day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">The king</a> is pretty well to-day, though let blood the night before yesterday.</p>

		<p>Up and called out by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/">Lord Peterborough&#8217;s</a> gentleman to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a> to discourse about getting of his money, wherein I am concerned in hopes of the 50<i>l.</i> my Lord hath promised me, but I dare not reckon myself sure of it till I have it in my main, &#8212;[hand.]&#8212; for these Lords are hard to be trusted. Though I well deserve it. I staid at Povy&#8217;s for his coming in, and there looked over his stables and every thing, but notwithstanding all the times I have been there I do yet find many fine things to look on.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> a little, to hear how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> do, he not having been well these three days. I find that he is pretty well again. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/182/">Paul&#8217;s Churchyarde</a> about my books, and to the binder&#8217;s and directed the doing of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7699/">my Chaucer</a>, though they were not full neate enough for me, but pretty well it is; and thence to the clasp-maker&#8217;s to have it clasped and bossed. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> till 5 o&#8217;clock, and then came <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a>, and we sung an houre or two. Then broke up and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Mr. Alsop</a> and his company came and consulted about our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> and brought it to a good head. So they parted, and I to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning. In the afternoon by coach with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there to a Committee for Fishing; but the first thing was swearing to be true to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">the Company</a>, and we were all sworne; but a great dispute we had, which, methought, is very ominous to the Company; some, that we should swear to be true to the best of our power, and others to the best of our understanding; and carried in the last, though in that we are the least able to serve the Company, because we would not be obliged to attend the business when we can, but when we list. This consideration did displease me, but it was voted and so went.</p>

<p>We did nothing else, but broke up till a Committee of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6917/">Guinny</a> was set and ended, and then met again for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, and there I did my business about my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3178/">Lord Peterborough&#8217;s</a> order and my own for my expenses for the garrison lately. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, by the way calling for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7699/">my Chaucer</a> and other books, and that is well done to my mind, which pleased me well. So to my office till late writing letters, and so home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to supper and bed, where we have not lain together because of the heat of the weather a good while, but now against her going into the country.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up and by water, towards noon, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/243/">Somersett House</a>, and walked to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, and there dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">my Lady</a> and the children. And after some ordinary discourse with my Lady, after dinner took our leaves and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> hers, in order to her going to the country to-morrow. But my Lord took not occasion to speak one word of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">mother</a> about the children at all, which I wonder at, and begin I will not.</p>

<p>Here my Lady showed us my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne&#8217;s</a> picture, finely done; given my Lord; and a most beautiful picture it is.</p>

<p>Thence with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/">Lady Jemimah</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1507/">Mr. Sidney</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1009/">St. Gyles&#8217;s Church</a>, and there heard a long, poore sermon.

		<p>But betimes up this morning, and, getting ready, we by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/530/">Holborne</a>, where, at nine o&#8217;clock, they set out, and I and my man <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">Will</a> on horseback, by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1780/">Barnett</a>; a very pleasant day; and there dined with her company, which was very good; a pretty gentlewoman with her, that goes but to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1670/">Huntington</a>, and a neighbour to us in towne. Here we staid two hours and then parted for all together, and my poor wife I shall soon want I am sure.</p>

<p>Thence I and Will to see the Wells,<sup id="fnr1-1664-07-11"><a href="#fn1-1664-07-11">1</a></sup> half a mile off, and there I drank three glasses, and went and walked and came back and drunk two more; the woman would have had me drink three more; but I could not, my belly being full, but this wrought very well, and so we rode home, round by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7502/">Kingsland</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7501/">Hackney</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7710/">Mile End</a> till we were quite weary, and my water working at least 7 or 8 times upon the road, which pleased me well, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> weary, and not being very well, I betimes to bed.</p>

<p>And there fell into a most mighty sweat in the night, about eleven o&#8217;clock, and there, knowing what money I have in the house and hearing a noyse, I begun to sweat worse and worse, till I melted almost to water. I rung, and could not in half an houre make either of the wenches hear me, and this made me fear the more, lest they might be gaga; and then I begun to think that there was some design in a stone being flung at the window over our stayres this evening, by which the thiefes meant to try what looking there would be after them and know our company. These thoughts and fears I had, and do hence apprehend the fears of all rich men that are covetous and have much money by them. At last <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7583/">Jane</a> rose, and then I understand it was only the dogg wants a lodging and so made a noyse. So to bed, but hardly slept, at last did, and so till morning.</p>

		<p>My mind being doubtful what the business should be, I rose a little after four o&#8217;clock, and abroad. Walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord&#8217;s</a>, and nobody up, but the porter rose out of bed to me so I back again to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleete Streete</a>, and there bought a little book of law; and thence, hearing a psalm sung, I went into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5184/">St. Dunstan&#8217;s</a>, and there heard prayers read, which, it seems, is done there every morning at six o&#8217;clock; a thing I never did do at a chappell, but the College Chappell, in all my life.</p>

<p>Thence to my Lord&#8217;s again, and my Lord being up, was sent for up, and he and I alone. He did begin with a most solemn profession of the same confidence in and love for me that he ever had, and then told me what a misfortune was fallen upon me and him: in me, by a displeasure which my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> did show to him last night against me, in the highest and most passionate manner that ever any man did speak, even to the not hearing of any thing to be said to him: but he told me, that he did say all that could be said for a man as to my faithfullnesse and duty to his Lordship, and did me the greatest right imaginable. And what should the business be, but that I should be forward to have the trees in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7303/">Clarendon Park</a> marked and cut down, which he, it seems, hath bought of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Lord Albemarle</a>; when, God knows! I am the most innocent man in the world in it, and did nothing of myself, nor knew of his concernment therein, but barely obeyed my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a> warrant for the doing thereof. And said that I did most ungentlemanlike with him, and had justified the rogues in cutting down a tree of his; and that I had sent the veriest <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/666/">Fanatique</a> [<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/">Deane</a>] that is in England to mark them, on purpose to nose &#8212;[provoke]&#8212; him. All which, I did assure my Lord, was most properly false, and nothing like it true; and told my Lord the whole passage. My Lord do seem most nearly affected; he is partly, I believe, for me, and partly for himself. So he advised me to wait presently upon my Lord, and clear myself in the most perfect manner I could, with all submission and assurance that I am his creature both in this and all other things; and that I do owne that all I have, is derived through my Lord Sandwich from his Lordship. So, full of horror, I went, and found him busy in tryals of law in his great room; and it being Sitting-day, durst not stay, but went to my Lord and told him so: whereupon he directed me to take him after dinner; and so away I home, leaving my Lord mightily concerned for me.</p>

<p>I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there sat busy all the morning. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and from the &#8217;Change over with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Alsopp</a> and the others to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9544/">Pope&#8217;s Head tavern</a>, and there staid a quarter of an hour, and concluded upon this, that in case I got them no more than 3<i>s.</i> per week per man I should have of them but 150<i>l.</i> per ann., but to have it without any adventure or charge, but if I got them 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, then they would give me 300<i>l.</i> in the like manner. So I directed them to draw up their tender in a line or two against the afternoon, and to meet me at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>. So I left them, and I to my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s; and there coming out after dinner I accosted him, telling him that I was the unhappy Pepys that had fallen into his high displeasure, and come to desire him to give me leave to make myself better understood to his Lordship, assuring him of my duty and service. He answered me very pleasingly, that he was confident upon the score of my Lord Sandwich&#8217;s character of me, but that he had reason to think what he did, and desired me to call upon him some evening: I named to-night, and he accepted of it. So with my heart light I to White Hall, and there after understanding by a stratagem, and yet appearing wholly desirous not to understand <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gauden&#8217;s</a> price when he desired to show it me, I went down and ordered matters in our tender so well that at the meeting by and by I was ready with Mr. Gauden&#8217;s and his, both directed him a letter to me to give the board their two tenders, but there being none but the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Generall Monk</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a> and I, I did not think fit to expose them to view now, but put it off till Saturday, and so with good content rose.</p>

<p>Thence I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/957/">Half Moone</a>, against the &#8217;Change, to acquaint <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Lanyon</a> and his friends of our proceedings, and thence to my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s, and there heard several tryals, wherein I perceive my Lord is a most able and ready man. After all done, he himself called, &#8220;Come, Mr. Pepys, you and I will take a turn in the garden.&#8221; So he was led down stairs, having the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/805/">goute</a>, and there walked with me, I think, above an houre, talking most friendly, yet cunningly. I told him clearly how things were; how ignorant I was of his Lordship&#8217;s concernment in it; how I did not do nor say one word singly, but what was done was the act of the whole <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/">Board</a>. He told me by name that he was more angry with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> than with me, and also with the whole body of the Board. But thinking who it was of the Board that knew him least, he did place his fear upon me; but he finds that he is indebted to none of his friends there. I think I did thoroughly appease him, till he thanked me for my desire and pains to satisfy him; and upon my desiring to be directed who I should of his servants advise with about this business, he told me nobody, but would be glad to hear from me himself. He told me he would not direct me in any thing, that it might not be said that the Lord Chancellor did labour to abuse <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>; or (as I offered) direct the suspending the Report of the Purveyors but I see what he means, and I will make it my worke to do him service in it. But, Lord! to see how he is incensed against poor Deane, as a fanatique rogue, and I know not what: and what he did was done in spite to his Lordship, among all his friends and tenants. He did plainly say that he would not direct me in any thing, for he would not put himself into the power of any man to say that he did so and so; but plainly told me as if he would be glad I did something.</p>

<p>Lord! to see how we poor wretches dare not do the King good service for fear of the greatness of these men.</p>

<p>He named Sir G. Carteret, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, and the rest; and that he was as angry with them all as me.</p>

<p>But it was pleasant to think that, while he was talking to me, comes into the garden Sir G. Carteret; and my Lord avoided speaking with him, and made him and many others stay expecting him, while I walked up and down above an houre, I think; and would have me walk with my hat on.</p>

<p>And yet, after all this, there has been so little ground for this his jealousy of me, that I am sometimes afeard that he do this only in policy to bring me to his side by scaring me; or else, which is worse, to try how faithfull I would be to the King; but I rather think the former of the two.</p>

<p>I parted with great assurance how I acknowledged all I had to come from his Lordship; which he did not seem to refuse, but with great kindness and respect parted. So I by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, calling at my Lord&#8217;s, but he not within.</p>

<p>At my office late, and so home to eat something, being almost starved for want of eating my dinner to-day, and so to bed, my head being full of great and many businesses of import to me.</p>

		<h1>
			
				<a href="/diary/1664/07/15/">Friday 15 July 1664</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a>; where he sent for me up, and I did give my Lord an account of what had passed with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> yesterday; with which he was well pleased, and advised me by all means to study in the best manner I could to serve him in this business. After this discourse ended, he begun to tell me that he had now pitched upon his day of going to sea upon Monday next, and that he would now give me an account how matters are with him.</p>

<p>He told me that his work now in the world is only to keep up his interest at Court, having little hopes to get more considerably, he saying that he hath now about 8,000<i>l.</i> per annum. It is true, he says, he oweth about 10,000<i>l.</i>; but he hath been at great charges in getting things to this pass in his estate; besides his building and good goods that he hath bought. He says he hath now evened his reckonings at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/946/">the Wardrobe</a> till <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1311/">Michaelmas</a> last, and hopes to finish it to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/557/">Ladyday</a> before he goes. He says now there is due, too, 7,000<i>l.</i> to him there, if he knew how to get it paid, besides 2000<i>l.</i> that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/670/">Mr. Montagu</a> do owe him. As to his interest, he says that he hath had all the injury done him that ever man could have by another bosom friend that knows all his secrets, by Mr. Montagu; but he says that the worst of it all is past, and he gone out and hated, his very person by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, and he believes the more upon the score of his carriage to him; nay, that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> did say a little while since in his closett, that he did hate him because of his ungratefull carriage to my Lord of Sandwich. He says that he is as great with the Chancellor, or greater, than ever in his life. That with the King he is the like; and told me an instance, that whereas he formerly was of the private council to the King before he was last sicke, and that by the sickness an interruption was made in his attendance upon him; the King did not constantly call him, as he used to do, to his private council, only in businesses of the sea and the like; but of late the King did send a message to him by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Sir Harry Bennet</a>, to excuse the King to my Lord that he had not of late sent for him as he used to do to his private council, for it was not out of any distaste, but to avoid giving offence to some others whom he did not name; but my Lord supposes it might be <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a>, or it may be only that the King would rather pass it by an excuse, than be thought unkind: but that now he did desire him to attend him constantly, which of late he hath done, and the King never more kind to him in his life than now. The Duke of Yorke, as much as is possible; and in the business of late, when I was to speak to my Lord about his going to sea, he says that he finds the Duke did it with the greatest ingenuity and love in the world; &#8220;and whereas,&#8221; says my Lord, &#8220;here is a wise man hard by that thinks himself so, and would be thought so, and it may be is in a degree so (naming by and by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/105/">Lord Crew</a>), would have had me condition with him that neither Prince Rupert nor any body should come over his head, and I know not what.&#8221; The Duke himself hath caused in his commission, that he be made Admirall of this and what other ships or fleets shall hereafter be put out after these; which is very noble. He tells me in these cases, and that of Mr. Montagu&#8217;s, and all others, he finds that bearing of them patiently is his best way, without noise or trouble, and things wear out of themselves and come fair again. But, says he, take it from me, never to trust too much to any man in the world, for you put yourself into his power; and the best seeming friend and real friend as to the present may have or take occasion to fall out with you, and then out comes all.</p>

<p>Then he told me of Sir Harry Bennet, though they were always kind, yet now it is become to an acquaintance and familiarity above ordinary, that for these months he hath done no business but with my Lord&#8217;s advice in his chamber, and promises all faithfull love to him and service upon all occasions. My Lord says, that he hath the advantage of being able by his experience to helpe and advise him; and he believes that that chiefly do invite Sir Harry to this manner of treating him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; says my Lord,&#8221; the only and the greatest embarras that I have in the world is, how to behave myself to Sir H. Bennet and my Lord Chancellor, in case that there do lie any thing under the embers about my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2845/">Lord Bristoll</a>, which nobody can tell; for then,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I must appear for one or other, and I will lose all I have in the world rather than desert my Lord Chancellor: so that,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I know not for my life what to do in that case.&#8221; For Sir H. Bennet&#8217;s love is come to the height, and his confidence, that he hath given my Lord a character, and will oblige my Lord to correspond with him. &#8220;This,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is the whole condition of my estate and interest; which I tell you, because I know not whether I shall see you again or no.&#8221; Then as to the voyage, he thinks it will be of charge to him, and no profit; but that he must not now look after nor think to encrease, but study to make good what he hath, that what is due to him from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/946/">the Wardrobe</a> or elsewhere may be paid, which otherwise would fail, and all a man hath be but small content to him.</p>

<p>So we seemed to take leave one of another; my Lord of me, desiring me that I would write to him and give him information upon all occasions in matters that concern him; which, put together with what he preambled with yesterday, makes me think that my Lord do truly esteem me still, and desires to preserve my service to him; which I do bless God for.</p>

<p>In the middle of our discourse my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2726/">Lady Crew</a> came in to bring my Lord word that he hath <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7721/">another son</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">my Lady</a> being brought to bed just now, I did not think her time had been so nigh, but she&#8217;s well brought to bed, for which God be praised! and send my Lord to study the laying up of something the more!</p>

<p>Then with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, and missing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a>, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>; where, staying for him in one of the galleries, there comes out of the chayre-room <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a>, in a most lovely form, with her hair all about her eares, having her picture taking there. There was the King and twenty more, I think, standing by all the while, and a lovely creature she in this dress seemed to be.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> by coach, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>. In the evening <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a> and I to my chamber to sing, which we did very pleasantly, and then to my office again, where very late and so home, with my mind I bless God in good state of ease and body of health, only my head at this juncture very full of business, how to get something. Among others what this rogue Creed will do before he goes to sea, for I would fain be rid of him and see what he means to do, for I will then declare myself his firm friend or enemy.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1664/07/16/">Saturday 16 July 1664</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up in the morning, my head mightily confounded with the great deale of business I have upon me to do. But to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there dispatched <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Mr. Creed&#8217;s</a> business pretty well about his bill; but then there comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/549/">W. Howe</a> for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord&#8217;s</a> bill of Imprest for 500<i>l.</i> to carry with him this voyage, and so I was at a loss how to carry myself in it, Creed being there, but there being no help I delivered it to them both, and let them contend, when I perceive they did both endeavour to have it, but W. Howe took it, and the other had the discretion to suffer it. But I think I cleared myself to Creed that it past not from any practice of mine. At noon rose and did some necessary business at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6390/">Trinity House</a> to a dinner which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> makes there as Maister this year. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Tangier Committee</a>, and there, above my expectation, got the business of our contract for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> carried for my people, viz., <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Alsopp</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Lanyon</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7720/">Yeabsly</a>.</p>

<p>And by their promise I do thereby get 300<i>l.</i> per annum to myself, which do overjoy me; and the matter is left to me to draw up. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5018/">Mr. Lewes</a> was in the gallery and is mightily amazed at it, and I believe <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gauden</a> will make some stir about it, for he wrote to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> to-day about it to argue why he should for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> convenience have it, but Mr. Coventry most justly did argue freely for them that served cheapest.</p>

<p>Thence walked a while with Mr. Coventry in the gallery, and first find that he is mighty cold in his present opinion of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/">Mr. Peter Pett</a> for his flagging and doing things so lazily there, and he did also surprise me with a question why <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/">Deane</a> did not bring in their report of the timber of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7303/">Clarendon</a>. What he means thereby I know not, but at present put him off; nor do I know how to steer myself: but I must think of it, and advise with my Lord Sandwich.</p>

<p>Thence with Creed by coach to my Lord Sandwich&#8217;s, and there I got <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/340/">Mr. Moore</a> to give me my Lord&#8217;s hand for my receipt of 109<i>l.</i> more of my money of Sir G. Carteret, so that then his debt to me will be under 500<i>l.</i>, I think. This do ease my mind also.</p>

<p>Thence carried him and W. Howe into London, and set them down at Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s to receive some money, and I home and there busy very late, and so home to supper and to bed, with my mind in pretty good ease, my business being in a pretty good condition every where.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> doing business there, it raining hard. So dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> alone. After dinner walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord&#8217;s</a>, and there found him and much other guests at table at dinner, and it seems they have christened his young son to-day &#8212; called him <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7721/">James</a>. I got a piece of cake. I got my Lord to signe and seale my business about my selling of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a> land, which though not so full as I would, yet is as full as I can at present. Walked <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> again, and there fell to read, and by and by comes my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/911/">uncle Wight</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2633/">Dr. Burnett</a>, and another gentleman, and talked and drank, and the Doctor showed me the manner of eating, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7123/">turpentine</a>, which pleases me well, for it is with great ease. So they being gone, I to supper and to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord&#8217;s</a>, and there took my leave of him, he seeming very friendly to me in as serious a manner as ever in his life, and I believe he is very confident of me. He sets out this morning for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/641/">Deale</a>. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>, and there did our usual business. He discourses very freely of a warr with Holland, to begin about winter, so that I believe we shall come to it. Before we went up to the Duke, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> and I did talk together in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Parke</a> about my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor&#8217;s</a> business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a>; he telling me freely that my Lord Chancellor was never so angry with him in all his life, as he was for this business, in great passion; and that when he saw me there, he knew what it was about. And plots now with me how we may serve my Lord, which I am mightily glad of; and I hope together we may do it.</p>

<p>Thence to Westminster to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6230/">my barber&#8217;s</a>, to have my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/517/">Periwigg</a> he lately made me cleansed of its nits, which vexed me cruelly that he should put such a thing into my hands. Here meeting his mayd <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7853/">Jane</a>, that has lived with them so long, I talked with her, and sending her of an errand to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/770/">Dr. Clerk&#8217;s</a>, did meet her, and took her into a little alehouse in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/918/">Brewers Yard</a>, and there did sport with her, without any knowledge of her though, and a very pretty innocent girl she is. Thence to my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s, but he being busy I went away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner. By and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, and I out with him to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleet Street</a>, and he to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a>, I to my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s, and missing him again walked to Povy&#8217;s, and there saw his new perspective in his closet. Povy, to my great surprise and wonder, did here attacque me in his own and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5181/">Mr. Bland&#8217;s</a> behalf that I should do for them both for the new contractors for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> of the garrison. Which I am ashamed that he should ask of me, nor did I believe that he was a man that did seek benefit in such poor things. Besides that he professed that he did not believe that I would have any hand myself in the contract, and yet here declares that he himself would have profit by it, and himself did move me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider</a> might join, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Ford</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Gauden</a>. I told him I had no interest in them, but I fear they must do something to him, for he told me that those of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5384/">Mole</a> did promise to consider him. Thence home and Creed with me, and there he took occasion to owne his obligations to me, and did lay down twenty pieces in gold upon my shelf in my closett, which I did not refuse, but wish and expected should have been more. But, however, this is better than nothing, and now I am out of expectation, and shall henceforward know how to deal with him.</p>

<p>After discourse of settling his matters here, we went out by coach, and he &#8217;light at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a>, and there took final leave of me, in order to his following my Lord to-morrow. I to my Lord Chancellor, and discoursed his business with him. I perceive, and he says plainly, that he will not have any man to have it in his power to say that my Lord Chancellor did contrive the wronging <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> of his timber; but yet I perceive, he would be glad to have service done him therein; and told me Sir G. Carteret hath told him that he and I would look after his business to see it done in the best manner for him. Of this I was glad, and so away. Thence home, and late with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> men about drawing up their agreement with us, wherein I find much trouble, and after doing as much as we could to-night, broke up and I to bed.</p>

At noon dined alone at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>. After dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W.

We went up to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7562/">his widow</a>, who is sicke in bed also. The poor woman in great sorrow, and entreats our friendship, which we shall, I think, in every thing do for her. I am sure I will. Thence to the Docke, and there in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5055/">Sheldon&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8992/">garden</a> eat some fruit; so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> a little, and thence home, it raining mightily, and being cold I doubted my health after it. At the office till 9 o&#8217;clock about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren&#8217;s</a> contract for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5619/">masts</a>, and then at home with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Lanyon</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7720/">Yeabsly</a> till 12 and past about their contract for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, wherein they and I differed, for I would have it drawn to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> advantage, as much as might be, which they did not like, but parted good friends; however, when they were gone, I wished that I had forborne any disagreement till I had had their promise to me in writing.</p>

<p>They being gone, I to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and a while to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/">Mr. Deane</a> till dinner, discoursing upon the business of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7303/">Clarendon Parke</a>, and how to make a report therein without offending him; which at last I drew up, and hope it will please him. But I would to God neither I nor he ever had had any thing to have done with it!</p>

<p>Dined together with a good pig, and then out by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">Committee for Fishing</a>; but nothing done, it being a great day to-day there upon drawing at the Lottery of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6657/">Sir Arthur Slingsby</a>. I got in and stood by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/">two</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">Queenes</a> and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1402/">Duchesse of Yorke</a>, and just behind my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne</a>, whom I do heartily adore; and good sport it was to see how most that did give their ten pounds did go away with a pair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6732/">globes</a> only for their lot, and one gentlewoman, one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7727/">Mrs. Fish</a>, with the only blanke. And one I staid to see drew a suit of hangings valued at 430<i>l.</i>, and they say are well worth the money, or near it. One other suit there is better than that; but very many lots of three and fourscore pounds. I observed <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and Queenes did get but as poor lots as any else. But the wisest man I met with was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Mr. Cholmley</a>, who insured as many as would, from drawing of the one blank for 12<i>d.</i>; in which case there was the whole number of persons to one, which I think was three or four hundred. And so he insured about 200 for 200 shillings, so that he could not have lost if one of them had drawn it, for there was enough to pay the 10<i>l.</i>; but it happened another drew it, and so he got all the money he took. I left the lottery, and went to a play, only a piece of it, which was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2935/">the Duke&#8217;s house</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7728/">&#8220;Worse and Worse;&#8221;</a> just the same manner of play, and writ, I believe, by the same man as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5802/">&#8220;The Adventures of Five Hours;&#8221;</a> very pleasant it was, and I begin to admire <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6533/">Harris</a> more than ever.</p>

<p>Thence to Westminster to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, and he and I took a walk in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Parke</a>. He is ill, and not able yet to set out after <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord</a>, but will do to-morrow. So home, and late at my office, and so home to bed.</p>

<p>This evening being moonshine I played a little late upon my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/783/">flageolette</a> in the garden.</p>

<p>But being at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> I met with great news that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Lane</a> is married to one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">Martin</a>, one that serves <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3165/">Captain Marsh</a>. She is gone abroad with him to-day, very fine. I must have a bout with her very shortly to see how she finds marriage.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning, among other things making a contract with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> for almost 1000 <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9624/">Gottenburg</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5619/">masts</a>, the biggest that ever was made in the Navy, and wholly of my compassing and a good one I hope it is for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>. Dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, where I have not eat these many months. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, and myself there only, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">my Lady</a>. A good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/384/">venison pasty</a>, and very merry, and pleasant I made myself with my Lady, and she as much to me. This morning to the office comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/991/">Nicholas Osborne</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gauden&#8217;s</a> clerke, to desire of me what piece of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/">plate</a> I would choose to have a 100<i>l.</i>, or thereabouts, bestowed upon me in, he having order to lay out so much; and, out of his freedom with me, do of himself come to make this question. I a great while urged my unwillingnesse to take any, not knowing how I could serve Mr. Gauden, but left it wholly to himself; so at noon I find brought home in fine leather cases, a pair of the noblest flaggons that ever I saw all the days of my life; whether I shall keepe them or no I cannot tell; for it is to oblige me to him in the business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a>, wherein I doubt I shall not; but glad I am to see that I shall be sure to get something on one side or other, have it which will: so, with a merry heart, I looked upon them, and locked them up.</p>

<p>After dinner to [give] my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a> a good account of his business, and he is very well pleased therewith, and carries himself with great discretion to me, without seeming over glad or beholding to me; and yet I know that he do think himself very well served by me.</p>

<p>Thence to Westminster and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Lane&#8217;s</a> lodgings, to give her joy, and there suffered me to deal with her as I hoped to do, and by and by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">her husband</a> comes, a sorry, simple fellow, and his letter to her which she proudly showed me a simple, nonsensical thing. A man of no discourse, and I fear married her to make a prize of, which he is mistaken in, and a sad wife I believe she will prove to him, for she urged me to appoint a time as soon as he is gone out of town to give her a meeting next week.</p>

<p>So by water with a couple of cozens of Mrs. Lane&#8217;s, and set them down at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2302/">Queenhive</a>, and I through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">Bridge</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there late at business, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, where busy all the morning. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then down by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, where coming too soon, I spent an houre in looking round the yarde, and putting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6172/">Mr. Shish</a> to measure a piece or two of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a>, which he did most cruelly wrong, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> losse 12 or 13<i>s.</i> in a piece of 28 feet in contents. Thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5015/">Clerke of the Cheques</a>, from whose house <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2700/">Mr. Falconer</a> was buried to-day; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> and I the only principal officers that were there.</p>

<p>We walked to church with him, and then I left them without staying the sermon and straight home by water, and there find, as I expected, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a>, and one slovenly and ugly fellow, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7730/">Seignor Pedro</a>, who sings Italian songs to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/457/">theorbo</a> most neatly, and they spent the whole evening in singing the best piece of musique counted of all hands in the world, made by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7731/">Seignor Charissimi</a>, the famous master in Rome. Fine it was, indeed, and too fine for me to judge of.</p>

<p>They have spoke to Pedro to meet us every weeke, and I fear it will grow a trouble to me if we once come to bid judges to meet us, especially idle Masters, which do a little displease me to consider.</p>

<p>They gone comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Mr. Lanyon</a>, who tells me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Mr. Alsopp</a> is now become dangerously ill, and fears his re covery, covery, which shakes my expectation of 300<i>l.</i> per annum by the business; and, therefore, bless God for what <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gauden</a> hath sent me, which, from some discourse to-day with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/991/">Mr. Osborne</a>, swearing that he knows not any thing of this business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a>; but, the contrary, that it is not that moves Mr. Gauden to send it me, for he hath had order for it any time these two months. Whether this be true or no, I know not; but I shall hence with the more confidence keepe it.</p>

<p>To supper and to the office a little, and to walk in the garden, the moon shining bright, and fine warm fair weather, and so home to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where I took occasion to break the business of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> in the best manner I could. He professed to me, that, till, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> did speake of it at the table, after our officers were gone to survey it, he did not know that my Lord Chancellor had any thing to do with it; but now he says that he had been told by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> that Sir G. Carteret had spoke to him about it, and that he had told the Duke that, were he in my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s case, if he were his father, he would rather fling away the gains of two or 3,000<i>l.</i>, than have it said that the timber, which should have been <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a>, if it had continued the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle&#8217;s</a>, was concealed by us in favour of my Lord Chancellor; for, says he, he is a great man, and all such as he, and he himself particularly, have a great many enemies that would be glad of such an advantage against him.</p>

<p>When I told him it was strange that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, that knew my Lord Chancellor&#8217;s concernment therein, should not at first inform us, he answered me that for Sir J. Minnes, he is looked upon to be an old good companion, but by nobody at the other end of the towne as any man of business, and that my Lord Chancellor, he dares say, never did tell him of it, only Sir G. Carteret, he do believe, must needs know it, for he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5304/">Sir J. Shaw</a> are the greatest confidants he hath in the world.</p>

<p>So for himself, he said, he would not mince the matter, but was resolved to do what was fit, and stand upon his owne legs therein, and that he would speak to the Duke, that he and Sir G. Carteret might be appointed to attend my Lord Chancellor in it.</p>

<p>All this disturbs me mightily. I know not what to say to it, nor how to carry myself therein; for a compliance will discommend me to Mr. Coventry, and a discompliance to my Lord Chancellor. But I think to let it alone, or at least meddle in it as little more as I can.</p>

<p>From thence walked toward Westminster, and being in an idle and wanton humour, walked through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6328/">Fleet Alley</a>, and there stood a most pretty wench at one of the doors, so I took a turn or two, but what by sense of honour and conscience I would not go in, but much against my will took coach and away, and away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there &#8217;light of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Lane</a>, and plotted with her to go over the water. So met at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14071/">White&#8217;s stairs</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7733/">Chanel Row</a>, and over to the old house at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6621/">Lambeth Marsh</a>, and there eat and drank, and had my pleasure of her twice, she being the strangest woman in talk of love to her husband sometimes, and sometimes again she do not care for him, and yet willing enough to allow me a liberty of doing what I would with her. So spending 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> upon her, I could do what I would, and after an hour&#8217;s stay and more back again and set her ashore there again, and I forward to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleet Street</a>, and called at Fleet Alley, not knowing how to command myself, and went in and there saw what formerly I have been acquainted with, the wickedness of these houses, and the forcing a man to present expense. The woman indeed is a most lovely woman, but I had no courage to meddle with her for fear of her not being wholesome, and so counterfeiting that I had not money enough, it was pretty to see how cunning she was, would not suffer me to have to do in any manner with her after she saw I had no money, but told me then I would not come again, but she now was sure I would come again, but I hope in God I shall not, for though she be one of the prettiest women I ever saw, yet I fear her abusing me.</p>

<p>So desiring God to forgive me for this vanity, I went <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, taking some books from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/">my bookseller</a>, and taking his lad home with me, to whom I paid 10<i>l.</i> for books I have laid up money for, and laid out within these three weeks, and shall do no more a great while I hope.</p>

<p>So to my office writing letters, and then home and to bed, weary of the pleasure I have had to-day, and ashamed to think of it.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, but there <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> being gone out we to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/">Lord Berkeley&#8217;s</a> chamber, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> being there, and among other things there met with a printed copy of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> commission for the repair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/">Paul&#8217;s</a>, which is very large, and large power for collecting money, and recovering of all people that had bought or sold formerly any thing belonging to the Church.</p>

<p>And here I find my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6899/">Lord Mayor of the City</a> set in order before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2519/">the Archbishopp</a> or any nobleman, though all the greatest officers of state are there.</p>

<p>But yet I do not hear by my Lord Berkeley, who is one of them, that any thing is like to come of it.</p>

<p>Thence back again homewards, and Sir W. Batten and I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/813/">Coffee-house</a>, but no newes, only <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">the plague</a> is very hot still, and encreases among the Dutch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">Home</a> to dinner, and after dinner walked forth, and do what I could I could not keep myself from going through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7372/">Fleet Lane</a>, but had the sense of safety and honour not to go in, and the rather being a holiday I feared I might meet with some people that might know me.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Cross</a>, and there called at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a> to see what I owed, but found nothing, and here being a couple of pretty ladies, lodgers in the kitchen, I staid a little there. Thence to my barber <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6230/">Gervas</a>, who this day buries his child, which it seems was born without a passage behind, so that it never voided any thing in the week or fortnight that it has been born.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/574/">Mr. Reeves</a>, it coming just now in my head to buy a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7744/">microscope</a>, but he was not within, so I walked all round that end of the town among the loathsome people and houses, but, God be thanked! had no desire to visit any of them. So home, where I met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Mr. Lanyon</a>, who tells me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Mr. Alsop</a> is past hopes, which will mightily disappoint me in my hopes there, and yet it may be not. I shall think whether it will be safe for me to venture myself or no, and come in as an adventurer.</p>

<p>He gone, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/735/">Mr. Cole</a> (my old Jack Cole) comes to see and speak with me, and his errand in short to tell me that he is giving over his trade; he can do no good in it, and will turn what he has into money and go to sea, his father being dead and leaving him little, if any thing. This I was sorry to hear, he being a man of good parts, but, I fear, debauched.</p>

<p>I promised him all the friendship I can do him, which will end in little, though I truly mean it, and so I made him stay with me till 11 at night, talking of old school stories, and very pleasing ones, and truly I find that we did spend our time and thoughts then otherwise than I think boys do now, and I think as well as methinks that the best are now. He supped with me, and so away, and I to bed.</p>

<p>And strange to see how we are all divided that were bred so long at school together, and what various fortunes we have run, some good, some bad.</p>

		<p>All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, at noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1107/">Anthony Joyce&#8217;s</a>, to our gossip&#8217;s dinner. I had sent a dozen and a half of bottles of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> thither, and paid my double share besides, which is 18<i>s.</i> Very merry we were, and when the women were merry and rose from table, I above with them, ne&#8217;er a man but I, I began discourse of my not getting of children, and prayed them to give me their opinions and advice, and they freely and merrily did give me these ten, among them (1) Do not hug <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> too hard nor too much; (2) eat no late suppers; (3) drink juyce of sage; (4) tent and toast; (5) wear cool holland drawers; (6) keep stomach warm and back cool; (7) upon query whether it was best to do at night or morn, they answered me neither one nor other, but when we had most mind to it; (8) wife not to go too straight laced; (9) myself to drink <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2511/">mum</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/386/">sugar</a>; (10) <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7745/">Mrs. Ward</a> did give me, to change my place. The 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th they all did seriously declare, and lay much stress upon them as rules fit to be observed indeed, and especially the last, to lie with our heads where our heels do, or at least to make the bed high at feet and low at head.</p>

<p>Very merry all, as much as I could be in such sorry company.</p>

<p>Great discourse of the fray yesterday in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2188/">Moorefields</a>, how the butchers at first did beat the weavers (between whom there hath been ever an old competition for mastery), but at last the weavers rallied and beat them. At first the butchers knocked down all for weavers that had green or blue aprons, till they were fain to pull them off and put them in their breeches. At last the butchers were fain to pull off their sleeves, that they might not be known, and were soundly beaten out of the field, and some deeply wounded and bruised; till at last the weavers went out tryumphing, calling 100<i>l.</i> for a butcher. I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/574/">Mr. Reeves</a> to see a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7744/">microscope</a>, he having been with me to-day morning, and there chose one which I will have.</p>

<p>Thence back and took up young <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6626/">Mrs. Harman</a>, a pretty bred and pretty humoured woman whom I could love well, though not handsome, yet for her person and carriage, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1428/">black</a>. By the way met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6860/">her husband</a> going for her, and set them both down at home, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> a while, and so to supper and bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and after some discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7746/">Mr. Duke</a>, who is to be Secretary to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">the Fishery</a>, and is now Secretary to the Committee for Trade, who I find a very ingenious man, I went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a>, and there heard a little of his empty discourse, and fain he would have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gauden</a> been the victualler for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, which none but a fool would say to me when he knows he hath made it his request to me to get him something of these men that now do it. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> being ill and in bed I did not stay, but to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> a little, walked up and down, and so home to fit papers against this afternoon, and after dinner to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> a little, and then to White Hall, where anon the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> came, and a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee</a> we had of Tangier, where I read over my rough draught of the contract for Tangier <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a>, and acquainted them with the death of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Mr. Alsopp</a>, which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Mr. Lanyon</a> had told me this morning, which is a sad consideration to see how uncertain a thing our lives are, and how little to be presumed of in our greatest undertakings.</p>

<p>The words of the contract approved of, and I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and there came Mr. Lanyon to me and brought my neighbour, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Mr. Andrews</a>, to me, whom he proposes for his partner in the room of Mr. Alsopp, and I like well enough of it.</p>

<p>We read over the contract together, and discoursed it well over and so parted, and I am glad to see it once over in this condition again, for Mr. Lanyon and I had some discourse to-day about my share in it, and I hope if it goes on to have my first hopes of 300<i>l.</i> per ann.</p>

<p>They gone, I to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This afternoon came my great store of Coles in, being 10 <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7747/">Chaldron</a>, so that I may see how long they will last me.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1664/07/28/">Thursday 28 July 1664</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning, dined, after <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">&#8217;Change</a>, at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and then abroad, and seeing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5434/">&#8220;The Bondman&#8221;</a> upon the posts, I consulted my oaths and find I may go safely this time without breaking it; I went thither, notwithstanding my great desire to have gone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6328/">Fleet Alley</a>, God forgive me, again. There I saw it acted. It is true, for want of practice, they had many of them forgot their parts a little; but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2307/">Betterton</a> and my poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4034/">Ianthe</a> outdo all the world. There is nothing more taking in the world with me than that play.</p>

<p>Thence to Westminster to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6230/">my barber&#8217;s</a>, and strange to think how when I find that Jervas himself did intend to bring home my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/517/">periwigg</a>, and not <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7853/">Jane</a> his maid, I did desire not to have it at all, for I had a mind to have her bring it home. I also went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/539/">Mr. Blagrave&#8217;s</a> about speaking to him for his kinswoman to come live with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, but they are not come to town, and so I home by coach and to my office, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>My present posture is thus: my wife in the country and my mayde <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6788/">Besse</a> with her and all quiett there. I am endeavouring to find a woman for her to my mind, and above all one that understands musique, especially singing. I am the willinger to keepe one because I am in good hopes to get 2 or 300<i>l.</i> per annum extraordinary by the business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, and yet <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6312/">Mr. Alsopp</a>, my chief hopes, is dead since my looking after it, and now <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Mr. Lanyon</a>, I fear, is, falling sicke too. I am pretty well in health, only subject to wind upon any cold, and then immediate and great pains.</p>

<p>All our discourse is of a Dutch warr and I find it is likely to come to it, for they are very high and desire not to compliment us at all, as far as I hear, but to send a good fleete to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6917/">Guinny</a> to oppose us there. My <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> newly gone to sea, and I, I think, fallen into his very good opinion again, at least he did before his going, and by his letter since, show me all manner of respect and confidence.</p>

<p>I am over-joyed in hopes that upon this month&#8217;s account I shall find myself worth 1000<i>l.</i>, besides the rich present of two silver and gilt flaggons which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gauden</a> did give me the other day.</p>

<p>I do now live very prettily at home, being most seriously, quietly, and neatly served by my two mayds <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7583/">Jane</a> and the girle <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">Su</a>, with both of whom I am mightily well pleased.</p>

<p>My greatest trouble is the settling of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a> Estate, that I may know what to expect, and how to be able to leave it when I die, so as to be just to my promise to my uncle <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2542/">Thomas</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/116/">his son</a>. The next thing is this cursed trouble my brother <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/">Tom</a> is likely to put us to by his death, forcing us to law with his creditors, among others <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1234/">Dr. Tom Pepys</a>, and that with some shame as trouble, and the last how to know in what manner as to saving or spending <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> lives, lest they should run me in debt as one of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/884/">my uncle&#8217;s</a> executors, and I never the wiser nor better for it. But in all this I hope shortly to be at leisure to consider and inform myself well.</p>

		<p>At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning dispatching of business, at noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> after dinner, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2784/">Tom Trice</a> about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1234/">Dr. Pepys&#8217;s</a> business, and thence it raining turned into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6328/">Fleet Alley</a>, and there was with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7748/">Cocke</a> an hour or so. The jade, whether I would not give her money or not enough; she would not offer to invite to do anything, but on the contrary saying she had no time, which I was glad of, for I had no mind to meddle with her, but had my end to see what a cunning jade she was, to see her impudent tricks and ways of getting money and raising the reckoning by still calling for things, that it come to 6 or 7 shillings presently. So away <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, glad I escaped without any inconvenience, and there came <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7730/">Seignor Pedro</a>, and great store of musique we had, but I begin to be weary of having a master with us, for it spoils, methinks, the ingenuity of our practice.</p>

<p>After they were gone comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5181/">Mr. Bland</a> to me, sat till 11 at night with me, talking of the garrison of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> and serving them with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6260/">pieces of eight</a>. A mind he hath to be employed there, but dares not desire any courtesy of me, and yet would fain engage me to be for him, for I perceive they do all find that I am the busy man to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> have right done him by inquiring out other bidders. Being quite tired with him, I got him gone, and so to bed.</p>

		<p>All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>; at noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where great talke of a rich present brought by an <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2494/">East India</a> ship from some of the Princes of India, worth to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> 70,000<i>l.</i> in two precious stones. After dinner to the office, and there all the afternoon making an end of several things against the end of the month, that I may clear all my reckonings tomorrow; also this afternoon, with great content, I finished the contracts for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Mr. Lanyon</a> and the rest, and to my comfort got him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a> to sign to the giving me 300<i>l.</i> per annum, by which, at least, I hope to be a 100<i>l.</i> or two the better.</p>

<p>Wrote many letters by the post to ease my mind of business and to clear my paper of minutes, as I did lately oblige myself to clear every thing against the end of the month. So at night with my mind quiet and contented to bed. This day I sent a side of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/383/">venison</a> and six bottles of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1105/">Kate Joyce</a>.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, where I have not been these many weeks. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and thither, inviting him yesterday, comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a>, at which I was a little troubled, but made up all very well, carrying him with me to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, where I was invited and all our families to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/384/">venison pasty</a>. Here good cheer and good discourse. After dinner Mr. Hill and I to my house, and there to musique all the afternoon. He being gone, in the evening I to my accounts, and to my great joy and with great thanks to Almighty God, I do find myself most clearly <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">worth 1014<i>l.</i></a>, the first time that ever I was worth 1000<i>l.</i> before, which is the height of all that ever I have for a long time pretended to. But by the blessing of God upon my care I hope to lay up something more in a little time, if this business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> goes on as I hope it will.</p>

<p>So with praise to God for this state of fortune that I am brought to as to wealth, and my condition being as I have at large set it down two days ago in this book, I home to supper and to bed, desiring God to give me the grace to make good use of what I have and continue my care and diligence to gain more.</p>
