		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and there all the morning sitting and at noon to dinner with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8054/">White Horse</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard Streete</a>, where, God forgive us! good sport with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke&#8217;s</a> having his mayde sicke of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">the plague</a> a day or two ago and sent to the pest house, where she now is, but he will not say anything but that she is well. But blessed be God! a good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14038/">Bill</a> this week we have; being but 237 in all, and 42 of the plague, and of them but six in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>: though my Lord Bruncker says, that these six are most of them in new parishes where they were not the last week. Here was with us also <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5908/">Mr. Williamson</a>, who the more I know, the more I honour.</p>

<p>Hence I slipt after dinner without notice <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and there close to my business at my office till twelve at night, having with great comfort returned to my business by some fresh vowes in addition to my former, and-more severe, and a great joy it is to me to see myself in a good disposition to business.</p>

<p>So home to supper and to my Journall and to bed.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1666/03/02/">Friday 2 March 1665/66</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, as I have of late resolved before 7 in the morning and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning, among other things setting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> with much pleasure to worke upon the ruling of some paper for the making of books for pursers, which will require a great deale of worke and they will earn a good deale of money by it, the hopes of which makes them worke mighty hard.</p>

<p>At noon dined and to the office again, and about 4 o&#8217;clock took coach and to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a> and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke&#8217;s</a> new house by appointment, there to spend an houre in talking and we were together above an hour, and very good discourse about the state of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> as to money, and particularly in the point of the Navy. He endeavours hard to come to a good understanding of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> accounts, and by his discourse I find Sir G. Carteret must be brought to it, and what a madman he is that he do not do it of himself, for the King expects the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> will call upon him for his promise of giving an account of the money, and he will be ready for it, which cannot be, I am sure, without Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s accounts be better understood than they are.</p>

<p>He seems to have a great esteem of me and my opinion and thoughts of things. After we had spent an houre thus discoursing and vexed that we do but grope so in the darke as we do, because the people, that should enlighten us, do not helpe us, we resolved fitting some things for another meeting, and so broke up. He shewed me his house, which is yet all unhung, but will be a very noble house indeed.</p>

<p>Thence by coach calling at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/">my bookseller&#8217;s</a> and carried <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> 10<i>l.</i> worth of books, all, I hope, I shall buy a great while.</p>

<p>There by appointment find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a> come to sup and take his last leave of me, and by and by in comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/">Mr. James Houbland</a> to bear us company, a man I love mightily, and will not lose his acquaintance. He told me in my eare this night what he and his brothers have resolved to give me, which is 200<i>l.</i>, for helping them out with two or three ships. A good sum and that which I did believe they would give me, and I did expect little less.</p>

<p>Here we talked and very good company till late, and then took leave of one another, and indeed I am heartily sorry for Mr. Hill&#8217;s leaving us, for he is a very worthy gentleman, as most I know. God give him a good voyage and successe in his business. Thus we parted and my wife and I to bed, heavy for the losse of our friend.</p>

		<p>All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, at noon to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2190/">Old James</a>, being sent for, and there dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir William Rider</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4966/">Cutler</a>, and others, to make an end with two Scots Maisters about the freight of two ships of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5728/">Lord Rutherford&#8217;s</a>. After a small dinner and a little discourse I away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8246/">the Crowne</a> behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1637/">Fen</a>, about getting a bill of Cocke&#8217;s paid to Pen, in part for the East India goods he sold us. Here Sir W. Pen did give me the reason in my eare of his importunity for money, for that he is now to marry <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">his daughter</a>. God send her better fortune than her father deserves I should wish him for a false rogue.</p>

<p>Thence by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a>, and there saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> sit; and I do like her picture mightily, and very like it will be, and a brave piece of work. But he do complain that her nose hath cost him as much work as another&#8217;s face, and he hath done it finely indeed. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and late at the office, and then to bed.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). And all day at my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> and private accounts, having neglected them since <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/314/">Christmas</a>, which I hope I shall never do again; for I find the inconvenience of it, it being ten times the labour to remember and settle things. But I thank God I did it at last, and brought them all fine and right; and I am, I thinke, by all appears to me (and I am sure I cannot be 10<i>l.</i> wrong), <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">worth above 4600<i>l.</i></a>, for which the Lord be praised! being the biggest sum I ever was worth yet.</p>

		<p>I was at it till past two o&#8217;clock on Monday morning, and then read my vowes, and to bed with great joy and content that I have brought my things to so good a settlement, and now having my mind fixed to follow my business again and sensible of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a> jealousies, I doubt, concerning me, partly my siding with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and partly that indeed I have been silent in my business of the office a great while, and given but little account of myself and least of all to him, having not made him one visitt since he came to towne from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8232/">Oxford</a>, I am resolved to fall hard to it again, and fetch up the time and interest I have lost or am in a fair way of doing it.</p>

<p>Up about eight o&#8217;clock, being called up by several people, among others by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9606/">Mr. Moone</a>, with whom I went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard Streete</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8583/">Colvill</a>, and so back again and in my chamber he and I did end all our businesses together of accounts for money upon bills of Exchange, and am pleased to find myself reputed a man of business and method, as he do give me out to be. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> at noon and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner. Newes for certain of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8841/">King of Denmarke&#8217;s</a> declaring for the Dutch, and resolution to assist them.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there all the afternoon. In the evening come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/">Mr. James</a> and brother Houblons to agree upon share parties for their ships, and did acquaint me that they had paid my messenger, whom I sent this afternoon for it, 200<i>l.</i> for my friendship in the business, which pleases me mightily. They being gone I forth late to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir R. Viner&#8217;s</a> to take a receipt of them for the 200<i>l.</i> lodged for me there with them, and so back home, and after supper to bed.</p>

		<p>Up betimes and did much business before office time. Then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and there till noon and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner and to the office again till night. In the evening being at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, stepped in (for I have not used to go thither a good while), I find my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Mrs. Williams</a>, and they would of their own accord, though I had never obliged them (nor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> neither) with one visit for many of theirs, go see my house and my wife; which I showed them and made them welcome with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> and China <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/391/">oranges</a> (now a great rarity since the war, none to be had). There being also <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3028/">Mrs. Turner</a>, who had never been in my house since I come to the office before, and Mrs. Carcasse, wife of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Mr. Carcasses</a>. My house happened to be mighty clean, and did me great honour, and they mightily pleased with it. They gone I to the office and did some business, and then home to supper and to bed. My mind troubled through a doubtfulness of my having incurred <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a> displeasure by not having waited on him since his coming to towne, which is a mighty faulte and that I can bear the fear of the bad effects of till I have been with him, which shall be to-morrow, God willing. So to bed.</p>

		<p>Up betimes, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, thinking <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> had lain there; but he do not, but at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>; so thither I went and had as good a time as heart could wish, and after an houre in his chamber about publique business he and I walked up, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> being gone abroad we walked an houre in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5840/">Matted Gallery</a>: he of himself begun to discourse of the unhappy differences between him and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord of Sandwich</a>, and from the beginning to the end did run through all passages wherein my Lord hath, at any time, gathered any dissatisfaction, and cleared himself to me most honourably; and in truth, I do believe he do as he says. I did afterwards purge myself of all partiality in the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, (whose story Sir W. Coventry did also run over,) that I do mind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> interest, notwithstanding my relation to him; all which he declares he firmly believes, and assures me he hath the same kindnesse and opinion of me as ever. And when I said I was jealous of myself, that having now come to such an income as I am, by his favour, I should not be found to do as much service as might deserve it; he did assure me, he thinks it not too much for me, but thinks I deserve it as much as any man in England. All this discourse did cheer my heart, and sets me right again, after a good deal of melancholy, out of fears of his disinclination to me, upon the differences with my Lord Sandwich and Sir G. Carteret; but I am satisfied throughly, and so went away quite another man, and by the grace of God will never lose it again by my folly in not visiting and writing to him, as I used heretofore to do. Thence by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a>, and it being a holyday, a fast-day, there &#8217;light, and took water, being invited, and down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a>, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke&#8217;s</a>, where dined, he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8019/">Matt. Wren</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9670/">Boltele</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9751/">Major Cooper</a>, who is also a very pretty companion; but they all drink hard, and, after dinner, to gaming at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/797/">cards</a>. So I provoked my Lord to be gone, and he and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9529/">Mr. Cottle&#8217;s</a> and met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Mrs. Williams</a> (without whom he cannot stir out of doors) and there took coach and away home. They carry me to London and set me down at the Temple, where my mind changed and I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and to writing and heare <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a> play on the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/540/">lute</a>, and a turne with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> pleasantly in the garden by moonshine, my heart being in great peace, and so home to supper and to bed. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">The King</a> and Duke are to go to-morrow to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9752/">Audly End</a>, in order to the seeing and buying of it of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2521/">Lord Suffolke</a>.</p>

Coventry</a>.</p>

<p>Thence by water down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, where I met my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W.

Thence I left them and walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>, and there taking water was overtaken by them in their boat, and so they would have me in with them to Castle&#8217;s house, where my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">Lady Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Madam Williams</a> were, and there dined and a deale of doings. I had a good dinner and counterfeit mirthe and pleasure with them, but had but little, thinking how I neglected my business. Anon, all home to Sir W. Batten&#8217;s and there <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Mrs. Knipp</a> coming we did spend the evening together very merry. She and I singing, and, God forgive me! I do still see that my nature is not to be quite conquered, but will esteem pleasure above all things, though yet in the middle of it, it has reluctances after my business, which is neglected by my following my pleasure. However musique and women I cannot but give way to, whatever my business is. They being gone I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> a while and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there busy sitting till noon. I find at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a> come to dine with me. We were mighty merry; and, after dinner, I carried them and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> out by coach to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, and there I did give my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/312/">valentine</a>, Mrs. Pierce, a dozen payre of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a>, and a payre of silke stockings, and Knipp for company&#8217;s sake, though my wife had, by my consent, laid out 20<i>s.</i> upon her the other day, six payre of gloves. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a> to have seen our pictures, but could not get in, he being abroad, and so to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9755/">Cakehouse</a> hard by, and there sat in the coach with great pleasure, and eat some fine <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/395/">cakes</a> and so carried them to Pierces and away home. It is a mighty fine witty boy, Mrs. Pierces <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9472/">little boy</a>. Thence home and to the office, where late writing letters and leaving a great deale to do on Monday, I home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>The truth is, I do indulge myself a little the more in pleasure, knowing that this is the proper age of my life to do it; and out of my observation that most men that do thrive in the world, do forget to take pleasure during the time that they are getting their estate, but reserve that till they have got one, and then it is too late for them to enjoy it with any pleasure.</p>

		<p>Up, and met by 6 o&#8217;clock in my chamber <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a> (from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>) about evening reckonings between him and me, on our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> business, and at it hard till toward eight o&#8217;clock, and he then carried me in his chariot to White Hall, where by and by my fellow officers met me, and we had a meeting before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>. Thence with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> towards London, and in our way called in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/126/">Covent Garden</a>, and took in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9589/">Sir John (formerly Dr.) Baber</a>; who hath this humour that he will not enter into discourse while any stranger is in company, till he be told who he is that seems a stranger to him. This he did declare openly to me, and asked my Lord who I was, giving this reason, that he has been inconvenienced by being too free in discourse till he knew who all the company were. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/129/">Guildhall</a> (in our way taking in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1626/">Dr. Wilkins</a>), and there my Lord and I had full and large discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9766/">Sir Thomas Player</a>, the Chamberlain of the City (a man I have much heard of for his credit and punctuality in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, and on that score I had a desire to be made known to him), about the credit of our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, which are lodged there for security to such as should lend money thereon to the use of the Navy. And I had great satisfaction therein: and the truth is, I find all our matters of credit to be in an ill condition. Thence, I being in a little haste walked before and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> a little and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and presently to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6390/">Trinity house</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3376/">Captain Cox</a> made his Elder Brother&#8217;s dinner. But it seemed to me a very poor sorry dinner. I having many things in my head rose, when my belly was full, though the dinner not half done, and home and there to do some business, and by and by out of doors and met Mr. Povy coming to me by appointment, but it being a little too late, I took a little pride in the streete not to go back with him, but prayed him to come another time, and I away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1105/">Kate Joyce&#8217;s</a>, thinking to have spoke to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1107/">her husband</a> about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">Pall&#8217;s</a> business, but a stranger, the Welsh <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9767/">Dr. Powell</a>, being there I forebore and went away and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a>, to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> picture, which I like mighty well, and there had the pleasure to see how suddenly he draws the Heavens, laying a darke ground and then lightening it when and where he will. Thence to walk all alone in the fields behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/249/">Grayes Inne</a>, making an end of reading over my dear <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6530/">&#8220;Faber fortunae,&#8221;</a> of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6529/">Lord Bacon&#8217;s</a>, and thence, it growing dark, took two or three wanton turns about the idle places and lanes about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/431/">Drury Lane</a>, but to no satisfaction, but a great fear of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">the plague</a> among them, and so anon I walked by invitation to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierces</a>, where I find much good company, that is to say, Mrs. Pierce, my wife, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8676/">Mrs. Worshipp</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8677/">her daughter</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6533/">Harris</a> the player, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8955/">Mrs. Barbary Sheldon</a>, who is come this day to spend a weeke with my wife; and here with musique we danced, and sung and supped, and then to sing and dance till past one in the morning; and much mirthe with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6462/">Sir Anthony Apsley</a> and one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9768/">Colonell Sidney</a>, who lodge in the house; and above all, they are mightily taken with Mrs. Knipp. Hence weary and sleepy we broke up, and I and my company homeward by coach and to bed.</p>

I like him as a most good-natured, and discreet man, and, I believe, very cunning. We come to this conclusion for us to meete one another the next weeke, and then we hope to come to some end, for I did declare myself well satisfied with the match. Thence to Hales&#8217;s, where I met my wife and people; and do find the picture, above all things, a most pretty picture, and mighty like my wife; and I asked him his price: he says 14<i>l.</i>, and the truth is, I think he do deserve it. Thence toward London and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and I to the office, where I did much, and betimes to bed, having had of late so little sleep, and there slept&#8230; [Continued <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/03/16/">tomorrow</a>.

		<p>[Continued from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/03/15/">yesterday</a>. P.G.] &#8230;till 7 this morning. Up and all the morning about the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Victualler&#8217;s</a> business, passing his account. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and did several businesses, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8246/">the Crowne</a> behind the &#8217;Change and dined with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1637/">Fenn</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Madam Williams</a>, who without question must be my Lord&#8217;s wife, and else she could not follow him wherever he goes and kisse and use him publiquely as she do. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> and I made an end of the Victualler&#8217;s business, and thence abroad about several businesses, and so in the evening back again, and anon called on by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>, and he and I staid together in my chamber till 12 at night ending our reckonings and giving him <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> for all I was to pay him and so parted, and I to make good my Journall for two or three days, and begun it till I come to the other side, where I have scratched so much, for, for want of sleep, I begun to write idle and from the purpose. So forced to breake off, and to bed. &#8212;[There are several erasures in the original MS.]</p>

		<p>Up, and to finish my Journall, which I had not sense enough the last night to make an end of, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where very busy all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner and presently with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a>, where I am still infinitely pleased with my wife&#8217;s picture. I paid him 14<i>l.</i> for it, and 25<i>s.</i> for the frame, and I think it is not a whit too deare for so good a picture. It is not yet quite finished and dry, so as to be fit to bring home yet. This day I begun to sit, and he will make me, I think, a very fine picture. He promises it shall be as good as my wife&#8217;s, and I sit to have it full of shadows, and do almost break my neck looking over my shoulder to make the posture for him to work by. Thence home and to the office, and so home having a great cold, and so my wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8955/">Mrs. Barbary</a> have very great ones, we are at a loss how we all come by it together, so to bed, drinking <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5694/">butter-ale</a>. This day my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> comes from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a> and gives me an instance of another piece of knavery of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, who wrote to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7120/">Commissioner Middleton</a>, that it was my negligence the other day he was not acquainted, as the board directed, with our clerks coming down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4137/">the pay</a>. But I need no new arguments to teach me that he is a false rogue to me and all the world besides.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up and my cold better, so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and so walked out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9769/">St. James&#8217;s Church</a>, thinking to have seen faire <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/337/">Mrs. Butler</a>, but could not, she not being there, nor, I believe, lives thereabouts now.</p>

<p>So walked to Westminster, very fine fair dry weather, but all cry out for lack of rain. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">Herbert&#8217;s</a> and drank, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin&#8217;s</a>, and did what I would with her; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">her husband</a> going for some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> for us. The poor man I do think would take pains if I can get him a purser&#8217;s place, which I will endeavour. She tells me as a secret that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Howlet</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">the Hall</a>, my little sweetheart, that I used to call my second wife, is married to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">younger son</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1100/">Mr. Michell&#8217;s</a> (his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9770/">elder brother</a>, who should have had her, being dead this <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">plague</a>), at which I am glad, and that they are to live nearer me in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1233/">Thames Streete</a>, by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>.</p>

<p>Thence by coach home and to my chamber about some accounts, and so to bed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8323/">Sir Christopher Mings</a> is come home from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7009/">Hambro</a> without anything done, saving bringing home some pipestaves for us.</p>

		<p>Up betimes and upon a meeting extraordinary at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> most of the morning with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, upon the business of the accounts. Where now we have got almost as much as we would have we begin to lay all on the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Controller</a>, and I fear he will be run down with it, for he is every day less and less capable of doing business. Thence with my Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Coventry to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">ticket</a> office, to see in what little order things are there, and there it is a shame to see how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> is served. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9766/">the Chamberlain of London</a>, and satisfy ourselves more particularly how much credit we have there, which proves very little. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6083/">Sir Robert Long&#8217;s</a>, absent. About much the same business, but have not the satisfaction we would have there neither. So Sir W. Coventry parted, and my Lord and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Mrs. Williams&#8217;s</a>, and there I saw her closett, where indeed a great many fine things there are, but the woman I hate. Here we dined, and Sir J. Minnes come to us, and after dinner we walked to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/475/">King&#8217;s play-house</a>, all in dirt, they being altering of the stage to make it wider. But God knows when they will begin to act again; but my business here was to see the inside of the stage and all the tiring-rooms and machines; and, indeed, it was a sight worthy seeing. But to see their clothes, and the various sorts, and what a mixture of things there was; here a wooden-leg, there a ruff, here a hobbyhorse, there a crown, would make a man split himself to see with laughing; and particularly <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6368/">Lacy&#8217;s</a> wardrobe, and Shotrell&#8217;s. But then again, to think how fine they show on the stage by candle-light, and how poor things they are to look now too near hand, is not pleasant at all. The machines are fine, and the paintings very pretty.</p>

<p>Thence mightily satisfied in my curiosity I away with my Lord to see him at her house again, and so take leave and by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to the office, and thence sent for to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> by and by to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1024/">Broad Streete</a>, where he and I walked two or three hours till it was quite darke in his gallery talking of his affairs, wherein I assure him all will do well, and did give him (with great liberty, which he accepted kindly) my advice to deny <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/">the Board</a> nothing they would aske about his accounts, but rather call upon them to know whether there was anything more they desired, or was wanting. But our great discourse and serious reflections was upon the bad state of the kingdom in general, through want of money and good conduct, which we fear will undo all. Thence mightily satisfied with this good fortune of this discourse with him I home, and there walked in the darke till 10 o&#8217;clock at night in the garden with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, talking of many things belonging to us particularly, and I hope to get something considerably by him before the year be over. He gives me good advice of circumspection in my place, which I am now in great mind to improve; for I think our office stands on very ticklish terms, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> likely to sit shortly and likely to be asked more money, and we able to give a very bad account of the expence of what we have done with what they did give before. Besides, the turning out the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8052/">prize officers</a> may be an example for the King giving us up to the Parliament&#8217;s pleasure as easily, for we deserve it as much.</p>

<p>Besides, Sir G. Carteret did tell me tonight how my Lord Bruncker himself, whose good-will I could have depended as much on as any, did himself to him take notice of the many places I have; and though I was a painful man, yet the Navy was enough for any man to go through with in his owne single place there, which much troubles me, and shall yet provoke me to more and more care and diligence than ever.</p>

<p>Thence home to supper, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8955/">Mrs. Barbary</a> with great colds, as I also at this time have.</p>

<p>This day by letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> he propounds a match in the country for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">Pall</a>, which pleased me well, of one that hath seven score and odd pounds land per annum in possession, and expects 1000<i>l.</i> in money by the death of an old aunt. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9784/">He</a> hath neither father, mother, sister, nor brother, but demands 600<i>l.</i> down, and 100<i>l.</i> on the birth of first child, which I had some inclination to stretch to. He is kinsman to, and lives with, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2785/">Mr. Phillips</a>, but my wife tells me he is a drunken, ill-favoured, ill-bred country fellow, which sets me off of it again, and I will go on with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6860/">Harman</a>. So after supper to bed.</p>

I sat again, and had a great deale done, but, whatever the matter is, I do not fancy that it has the ayre of my face, though it will be a very fine picture. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to my business, being post night, and so home to supper and to, bed.</p>

		<p>Up betimes, and first by coach to my Lord Generall to visitt him, and then to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a>, where we all met and did our usual business with him; but, Lord! how everything is yielded to presently, even by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, that is propounded by the Duke, as now to have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9785/">Troutbecke</a>, his old surgeon, and intended to go Surgeon-General of the fleete, to go Physician-General of the fleete, of which there never was any precedent in the world, and he for that to have 20<i>l.</i> per month. Thence with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6083/">Sir Robert Long</a>, whom we found in his closett, and after some discourse of business he fell to discourse at large and pleasant, and among other things told us of the plenty of partridges in France, where he says the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> and his company killed with their guns, in the plain de Versailles, 300 and odd partridges at one bout.</p>

<p>Thence I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/291/">Excise Office</a> behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there find our business of our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> in great disorder as to payment, and thereupon do take a resolution of thinking how to remedy it, as soon as I can. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, and after I had eat a bit of victuals (he staying in the office) he and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>. He to look after the business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prize</a> ships which we are endeavouring to buy, and hope to get money by them. So I to London by coach and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, where I staid half an houre, and so away home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and there walking late alone in the darke in the garden with Sir W. Warren, who tells me that at the Committee of the Lords for the prizes to-day, there passed very high words between my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, about our business of the prize ships. And that my Lord Ashly did snuff and talk as high to him, as he used to do to any ordinary seaman. And that Sir W. Coventry did take it very quietly, but yet for all did speak his mind soberly and with reason, and went away, saying, he had done his duty therein, and so left it to them, whether they would let so many ships go for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5619/">masts</a> or not: Here he and I talked of 1,000 businesses, all profitable discourse, and late parted, and I home to supper and to bed, troubled a little at a letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a>, telling me how [he] is like to be sued for a debt of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/">Tom&#8217;s</a>, by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9786/">Smith</a>, the mercer.</p>

		<p>Up, and going out of my dressing-room, when ready to go down stairs, I spied little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9070/">Mrs. Tooker</a>, my pretty little girle, which, it seems, did come yesterday to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">our house</a> to stay a little while with us, but I did not know of it till now. I was glad of her coming, she being a very pretty child, and now grown almost a woman. I out by six o&#8217;clock by appointment to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a>, where we fell to my picture presently very hard, and it comes on a very fine picture, and very merry, pleasant discourse we had all the morning while he was painting. Anon comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> and little Tooker, and having done with me we all to a picture drawer&#8217;s hard by, Hales carrying me to see some landskipps of a man&#8217;s doing. But I do not [like] any of them, save only a piece of fruit, which indeed was very fine. Thence I to Westminster, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Chequer</a>, about a little business, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, and there sent for a bit of meat and dined; and after dinner had opportunity of being pleased with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">Sarah</a>; and so away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1101/">Mrs. Michell</a> tells me with great joy how little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Howlett</a> is married to her young son <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell</a>, which is a pretty odd thing, that he should so soon succeed in the match to his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9770/">elder brother</a> that died of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">the plague</a>, and to the house and trade intended for him, and more they say that the girle has heretofore said that she did love this little one more than the other brother that was intended her all along. I am mighty glad of this match, and more that they are likely to live near me in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1233/">Thames Streete</a>, where I may see Betty now and then, whom I from a girle did use to call my second wife, and mighty pretty she is.</p>

<p>Thence by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1107/">Anthony Joyce</a> to receive <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6860/">Harman&#8217;s</a> answer, which did trouble me to receive, for he now demands 800<i>l.</i>, whereas he never made exception at the portion, but accepted of 500<i>l.</i>. This I do not like; but, however, I cannot much blame the man, if he thinks he can get more of another than of me. So home and hard to my business at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where much business, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1107/">Anthony Joyce</a>, and I did give my final answer, I would give but 500<i>l.</i> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">my sister</a>, and did show him the good offer made us in the country, to which I did now more and more incline, and intend to pursue that. After dinner I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee for Tangier</a>, where the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> was, and I acquitted myself well in what I had to do. After the Committee up, I had occasion to follow the Duke into his lodgings, into a chamber where the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1402/">Duchesse</a> was sitting to have her picture drawn by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1488/">Lilly</a>, who was there at work. But I was well pleased to see that there was nothing near so much resemblance of her face in his work, which is now the second, if not the third time, as there was of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> at the very first time. Nor do I think at last it can be like, the lines not being in proportion to those of her face.</p>

<p>So home, and to the office, where late, and so to bed.</p>

		<p>(<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/557/">Lady day</a> and Sunday). Up, and to my chamber in my gowne all the morning about settling my papers there. At noon to dinner, where my wife&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">brother</a>, whom I sent for to offer making him a Muster-Master and send to sea, which the poore man likes well of and will go, and it will be a good preferment to him, only hazardous. I hope he will prove a good discreet man.</p>

<p>After dinner to my papers and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> accounts again till supper, and after supper again to them, but by my mixing them, I know not how, my private and publique accounts, it makes me mad to see how hard it is to bring them to be understood, and my head is confounded, that though I did sweare to sit up till one o&#8217;clock upon them, yet, I fear, it will be to no purpose, for I cannot understand what I do or have been doing of them to-day.</p>

		<p>Up, and a meeting extraordinary there was of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, and myself, about the business of settling the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">ticket</a> office, where infinite room is left for abusing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> in the wages of seamen. Our [meeting] being done, my Lord Bruncker and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>, to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6056/">the famous engraver</a>, to get him to grave a seale for the office. And did see some of the finest pieces of work in embossed work, that ever I did see in my life, for fineness and smallness of the images thereon, and I will carry <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> thither to shew them her. Here I also did see bars of gold melting, which was a fine sight. So with my Lord to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9544/">Pope&#8217;s Head Taverne</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard Streete</a> to dine by appointment with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2214/">Captain Taylor</a>, whither Sir W. Coventry come to us, and were mighty merry, and I find reason to honour him every day more and more.</p>

<p>Thence alone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1024/">Broade Street</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> by his desire to confer with him, who is I find in great pain about the business of the office, and not a little, I believe, in fear of falling there, Sir W. Coventry having so great a pique against him, and herein I first learn an eminent instance how great a man this day, that nobody would think could be shaken, is the next overthrown, dashed out of countenance, and every small thing of irregularity in his business taken notice of, where nobody the other day durst cast an eye upon them, and next I see that he that the other day nobody durst come near is now as supple as a spaniel, and sends and speaks to me with great submission, and readily hears to advice. Thence home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where busy late, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> a little to my accounts publique and private, but could not get myself rightly to know how to dispose of them in order to passing.</p>

Thence to the office to settle my people&#8217;s worke and then home to my publique accounts of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, which it is strange by meddling with evening reckonings with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a> lately how I myself am become intangled therein, so that after all I could do, ready to breake my head and brains, I thought of another way, though not so perfect, yet the only one which this account is capable of. Upon this latter I sat up till past two in the morning and then to bed.</p>

At noon dined and then out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard Streete</a>, to look after the getting of some money that is lodged there of mine in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Viner&#8217;s</a> hands, I having no mind to have it lie there longer. So back again and to the office, where and at home about publique and private business and accounts till past 12 at night, and so to bed. This day, poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a>, my old, little Jane, came to us again, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> and my great content, and we hope to take mighty pleasure in her, she having all the marks and qualities of a good and loving and honest servant, she coming by force away from the other place, where she hath lived ever since she went from us, and at our desire, her late mistresse having used all the stratagems she could to keepe her.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">My wife</a> and I mighty pleased with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane&#8217;s</a> coming to us again. Up, and away goes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8411/">Alce</a>, our cooke-mayde, a good servant, whom we loved and did well by her, and she an excellent servant, but would not bear being told of any faulte in the fewest and kindest words and would go away of her owne accord, after having given her mistresse warning fickly for a quarter of a yeare together. So we shall take another girle and make little Jane our cook, at least, make a trial of it.</p>

<p>Up, and after much business I out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard Streete</a>, and there received 2200<i>l.</i> and brought it <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>; and, contrary to expectation, received 35<i>l.</i> for the use of 2000<i>l.</i> of it [for] a quarter of a year, where it hath produced me this profit, and hath been a convenience to me as to care and security of my house, and demandable at two days&#8217; warning, as this hath been.</p>

<p>This morning <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> come to me a second time about having 2000<i>l.</i> of me upon his bills on the Act to enable him to pay for the ships he is buying, wherein I shall have considerable profit. I am loth to do it, but yet speaking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8583/">Colvill</a> I do not see but I shall be able to do it and get money by it too.</p>

<p>Thence home and eat one mouthful, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a>, and there sat till almost quite darke upon working my gowne, which I hired to be drawn in; an Indian gowne, and I do see all the reason to expect a most excellent picture of it.</p>

<p>So home and to my private accounts in my chamber till past one in the morning, and so to bed, with my head full of thoughts for my evening of all my accounts tomorrow, the latter end of the month, in which God give me good issue, for I never was in such a confusion in my life and that in great sums.</p>

		<p>All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> busy. At noon to dinner, and thence to the office and did my business there as soon as I could, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to my accounts, where very late at them, but, Lord! what a deale of do I have to understand any part of them, and in short do what I could, I could not come to any understanding of them, but after I had throughly wearied myself, I was forced to go to bed and leave them much against my will and vowe too, but I hope God will forgive me, for I have sat up these four nights till past twelve at night to master them, but cannot.</p>

<p>Thus ends this month, with my head and mind mighty full and disquiett because of my accounts, which I have let go too long, and confounded my publique with my private that I cannot come to any liquidating of them. However, I do see that I must be grown richer than I was by a good deale last month.</p>

<p>Busy also I am in thoughts for a husband for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">my sister</a>, and to that end <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I have determined that she shall presently go into the country to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">mother</a>, and consider of a proffer made them for her in the country, which, if she likes, shall go forward.</p>
