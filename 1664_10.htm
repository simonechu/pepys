		<p>Up and at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> both forenoon and afternoon very busy, and with great pleasure in being so. This morning <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Lane</a> (now Martin) like a foolish woman, came to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7907/">the Horseshoe</a> hard by, and sent for me while I was at the office to come to speak with her by a note sealed up, I know to get me to do something for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">her husband</a>, but I sent her an answer that I would see her at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1012/">Westminster</a>, and so I did not go, and she went away, poor soul.</p>

<p>At night <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to supper, weary, and my eyes sore with writing and reading, and to bed.</p>

<p>We go now on with great vigour in preparing against the Dutch, who, they say, will now fall upon us without doubt upon this high newes come of our beating them so, wholly in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6917/">Guinny</a>.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">My wife</a> not being well to go to church I walked with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a> through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, putting in at several churches, among others at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7908/">Bishopsgate</a>, and there saw the picture usually put before the King&#8217;s book, put up in the church, but very ill painted, though it were a pretty piece to set up in a church. I intended to have seen <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/305/">the Quakers</a>, who, they say, do meet every Lord&#8217;s day at the Mouth &#8212;[Tavern. D.W.]&#8212; at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2191/">Bishopsgate</a>; but I could see none stirring, nor was it fit to aske for the place, so I walked over <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2188/">Moorefields</a>, and thence to Clerkenwell church, and there, as I wished, sat next pew to the fair <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/337/">Butler</a>, who indeed is a most perfect beauty still; and one I do very much admire myself for my choice of her for a beauty, she having the best lower part of her face that ever I saw all days of my life. After church I walked to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">Lady Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, through my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Southampton&#8217;s</a> new buildings in the fields behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/249/">Gray&#8217;s Inn</a>; and, indeed, they are a very great and a noble work. So I dined with my Lady, and the same innocent discourse that we used to have, only after dinner, being alone, she asked me my opinion about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, whether he would have a wife or no, and what he was worth, and proposed <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7909/">Mrs. Wright</a> for him, which, she says, she heard he was once inquiring after. She desired I would take a good time and manner of proposing it, and I said I would, though I believed he would love nothing but money, and much was not to be expected there, she said.</p>

<p>So away back to <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2910/">Clerkenwell Church</a>, thinking to have got sight of la belle Boteler again, but failed, and so after church walked all over the fields home, and there my wife was angry with me for not coming home, and for gadding abroad to look after beauties, she told me plainly, so I made all peace, and to supper. This evening came <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Lane</a> (now Martin) with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">her husband</a> to desire my helpe about a place for him. It seems poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7910/">Mr. Daniel</a> is dead of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3221/">the Victualling Office</a>, a place too good for this puppy to follow him in. But I did give him the best words I could, and so after drinking a glasse of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> sent them going, but with great kindnesse. Go to supper, prayers, and to bed.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1664/10/03/">Monday 3 October 1664</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Up with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, by coach, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>; and there all the newes now of very hot preparations for the Dutch: and being with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>, he told us he was resolved to make a tripp himself, and that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> should go in the same ship with him. Which honour, God forgive me! I could grudge him, for his knavery and dissimulation, though I do not envy much the having the same place myself. Talke also of great haste in the getting out another fleete, and building some ships; and now it is likely we have put one another by each other&#8217;s dalliance past a retreate.</p>

<p>Thence with our heads full of business we broke up, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6230/">my barber&#8217;s</a>, and there only saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7853/">Jane</a> and stroked her under the chin, and away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a>, and there long about several businesses, hoping to get money by them, and thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner and there found <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/208/">Hawly</a>. But meeting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell&#8217;s wife</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> before I went home I took her into the office and there kissed her only. She rebuked me for doing it, saying that did I do so much to many bodies else it would be a stain to me. But I do not see but she takes it well enough, though in the main I believe she is very honest. So after some kind discourse we parted, and I home to dinner, and after dinner down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, where I found <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a>, and there we made, an experiment of Holland&#8217;s and our cordage, and ours outdid it a great deale, as my book of observations tells particularly. Here we were late, and so home together by water, and I to my office, where late, putting things in order. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5181/">Mr. Bland</a> came this night to me to take his leave of me, he going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, wherein I wish him good successe.</p>

<p>So home to supper and to bed, my mind troubled at the businesses I have to do, that I cannot mind them as I ought to do and get money, and more that I have neglected my frequenting and seeming more busy publicly than I have done of late in this hurry of business, but there is time left to recover it, and I trust in God I shall.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning, and this morning <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/643/">Chatham</a> to look after the ships now going out thence, and particularly that wherein <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> and himself go. He took <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3005/">Sir G. Ascue</a> with him, whom, I believe, he hath brought into play. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where I found my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6327/">aunt James</a> and the two <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1105/">she</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1749/">joyces</a>. They dined and were merry with us. Thence after dinner to a play, to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7905/">&#8220;The Generall;&#8221;</a> which is so dull and so ill-acted, that I think it is the worst I ever saw or heard in all my days. I happened to sit near to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6455/">Sir Charles Sidly</a>; who I find a very witty man, and he did at every line take notice of the dullness of the poet and badness of the action, that most pertinently; which I was mightily taken with; and among others where by Altemire&#8217;s command Clarimont, the Generall, is commanded to rescue his Rivall, whom she loved, Lucidor, he, after a great deal of demurre, broke out; &#8220;Well, I&#8217;le save my Rivall and make her confess, that I deserve, while he do but possesse.&#8221; &#8220;Why, what, pox,&#8221; says Sir Charles Sydly, &#8220;would he have him have more, or what is there more to be had of a woman than the possessing her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thence-setting all them at home, I home with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, vexed at my losing my time and above 20<i>s.</i> in money, and neglecting my business to see so bad a play. To-morrow they told us should be acted, or the day after, a new play, called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7927/">&#8220;The Parson&#8217;s Dreame,&#8221;</a> acted all by women.</p>

<p>So to my office, and there did business; and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up betimes and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and thence by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7820/">New Bridewell</a> to meet with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7890/">Mr. Poyntz</a> to discourse with him (being Master of the Workhouse there) about making of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6059/">Bewpers</a> for us. But he was not within; however his clerke did lead me up and down through all the house, and there I did with great pleasure see the many pretty works, and the little children employed, every one to do something, which was a very fine sight, and worthy encouragement. I cast away a crowne among them, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and among the Linnen Wholesale Drapers to enquire about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7929/">Callicos</a>, to see what can be done with them for the supplying our want of Bewpers for flaggs, and I think I shall do something therein to good purpose for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>. So to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/813/">Coffeehouse</a>, and there fell in discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7928/">the Secretary of the Virtuosi</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, and had very fine discourse with him. He tells me of a new invented instrument to be tried before the College anon, and I intend to see it. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6390/">Trinity House</a>, and there I dined among the old dull fellows, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to my office a while, and then comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7786/">Mr. Cocker</a> to see me, and I discoursed with him about his writing and ability of sight, and how I shall do to get some glasse or other to helpe my eyes by candlelight; and he tells me he will bring me the helps he hath within a day or two, and shew me what he do.</p>

<p>Thence to the Musique-meeting at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2767/">the Postoffice</a>, where I was once before. And thither anon come all the Gresham College, and a great deal of noble company: and the new instrument was brought called the Arched <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/461/">Viall</a>,<sup id="fnr1-1664-10-05"><a href="#fn1-1664-10-05">1</a></sup> where being tuned with lute-strings, and played on with kees like an organ, a piece of parchment is always kept moving; and the strings, which by the kees are pressed down upon it, are grated in imitation of a bow, by the parchment; and so it is intended to resemble several vyalls played on with one bow, but so basely and harshly, that it will never do. But after three hours&#8217; stay it could not be fixed in tune; and so they were fain to go to some other musique of instruments, which I am grown quite out of love with, and so I, after some good discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1060/">Mr. Spong</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2630/">Grant</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2213/">Dr. Whistler</a>, and others by turns, I home to my office and there late, and so home, where I understand my wife has spoke to Jane [Should be <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6788/">Bess</a>, according to L&M. P.G.] and ended matters of difference between her and her, and she stays with us, which I am glad of; for her fault is nothing but sleepiness and forgetfulness, otherwise a good-natured, quiet, well-meaning, honest servant, and one that will do as she is bid, so one called upon her and will see her do it.</p>

<p>This morning, by three o&#8217;clock, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince</a> &#8212;[Rupert]&#8212; and King, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke</a> with him, went down <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a>, and the Prince under sail the next tide after, and so is gone from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7662/">the Hope</a>.

		<p>Up and, it being rainy, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a> coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, and there did our usual business with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>, and more and more preparations every day appear against the Dutch, and (which I must confess do a little move my envy) Sir W. Pen do grow every day more and more regarded by the Duke,<sup id="fnr1-1664-10-10"><a href="#fn1-1664-10-10">1</a></sup> because of his service heretofore in the Dutch warr which I am confident is by some strong obligations he hath laid upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a>; for Mr. Coventry must needs know that he is a man of very mean parts, but only a bred seaman.</p>

<p>Going home in coach with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> he told me how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> by the means of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir R. Ford</a> was the last night brought to his house and did discover the reason of his so long discontent with him, and now they are friends again, which I am sorry for, but he told it me so plainly that I see there is no thorough understanding between them, nor love, and so I hope there will be no great combination in any thing, nor do I see Sir J. Minnes very fond as he used to be. But: Sir W. Batten do raffle still against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/921/">Mr. Turner</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3028/">his wife</a>, telling me he is a false fellow, and his wife a false woman, and has rotten teeth and false, set in with wire, and as I know they are so, so I am glad he finds it so.</p>

<p>To the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/813/">Coffee-house</a>, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and therewith <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7944/">the Coffee-house</a> behind the &#8217;Change, and sat alone with him till 4 o&#8217;clock talking of his businesses first and then of business in general, and discourse how I might get money and how to carry myself to advantage to contract no envy and yet make the world see my pains; which was with great content to me, and a good friend and helpe I am like to find him, for which God be thanked!</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner at 4 o&#8217;clock, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there late, and so home to supper and to bed, having sat up till past twelve at night to look over the account of the collections for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">the Fishery</a>, and the loose and base manner that monies so collected are disposed of in, would make a man never part with a penny in that manner, and, above all, the inconvenience of having a great man, though never so seeming pious as my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1392/">Lord Pembroke</a> is. He is too great to be called to an account, and is abused by his servants, and yet obliged to defend them for his owne sake. This day, by the blessing of God, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I have been married nine years: but my head being full of business, I did not think of it to keep it in any extraordinary manner. But bless God for our long lives and loves and health together, which the same God long continue, I wish, from my very heart!</p>

Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">the Fishery</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1233/">Thames Street</a>, and there several good discourses about the letting of the Lotterys, and, among others, one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7945/">Sir Thomas Clifford</a>, whom yet I knew not, do speak very well and neatly.</p>

<p>Thence I to my cozen <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1090/">Will Joyce</a> to get him to go to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a> with me this week, but I think he will not, and I am not a whit sorry for it, for his company both chargeable and troublesome.</p>

<p>So home and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and then to supper and then to my office again till late, and so home, with my head and heart full of business, and so to bed.</p>

<p>My wife tells me the sad news of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne&#8217;s</a> being now become so decayed, that one would not know her; at least far from a beauty, which I am sorry for.</p>

<p>This day with great joy <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/755/">Captain Titus</a> told us the particulars of the French&#8217;s expedition against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7946/">Gigery</a> upon the Barbary Coast, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3260/">the Straights</a>, with 6,000 chosen men.

		<p>After being at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning, I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and dined, and taking leave of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> with my mind not a little troubled how she would look after herself or house in my absence, especially, too, leaving a considerable sum of money in the office, I by coach to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7948/">Red Lyon</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2399/">Aldersgate Street</a>, and there, by agreement, met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1090/">W. Joyce</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2784/">Tom Trice</a>, and mounted, I upon a very fine mare that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> helps me to, and so very merrily rode till it was very darke, I leading the way through the darke to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3086/">Welling</a>, and there, not being very weary, to supper and to bed. But very bad accommodation at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7949/">the Swan</a>.</p>

<p>In this day&#8217;s journey I met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1317/">Mr. White</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/796/">Cromwell&#8217;s</a> chaplin that was, and had a great deale of discourse with him. Among others, he tells me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/168/">Richard</a> is, and hath long been, in France, and is now going into Italy. He owns publiquely that he do correspond, and return him all his money. That Richard hath been in some straits at the beginning; but relieved by his friends. That he goes by another name, but do not disguise himself, nor deny himself to any man that challenges him. He tells me, for certain, that offers had been made to the old man, of marriage between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1319/">his daughter</a>, to have obliged him, but he would not.<sup id="fnr1-1664-10-13"><a href="#fn1-1664-10-13">1</a></sup> He thinks (with me) that it never was in his power to bring in the King with the consent of any of his officers about him; and that he scorned to bring him in as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Monk</a> did, to secure himself and deliver every body else. When I told him of what I found writ in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7951/">a French book</a> of one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7950/">Monsieur Sorbiere</a>, that gives an account of his observations herein England; among other things he says, that it is reported that Cromwell did, in his life-time, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and that by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set up upon a post be that of Cromwell, or of one of the Kings; Mr. White tells me that he believes he never had so poor a low thought in him to trouble himself about it. He says the hand of God is much to be seen; that all his children are in good condition enough as to estate, and that their relations that betrayed their family are all now either hanged or very miserable.</p>

	<li id="fn1-1664-10-13">The Protector wished the Duke of Buckingham to marry his daughter Frances. She married, 1. Robert Rich, grandson and heir to Robert, Earl of Warwick, on November 11th, 1657, who died in the following February; 2. Sir John Russell, Bart. She died January 27th, 1721-22, aged eighty-four. In T. Morrice&#8217;s life of Roger, Earl of Orrery, prefixed to Orrery&#8217;s &#8220;State Letters&#8221; (Dublin, 1743, vol. i., p. 40), there is a circumstantial account of an interview between Orrery (then Lord Broghill) and Cromwell, in which the former suggested to the latter that Charles II. should marry Frances Cromwell. Cromwell gave great attention to the reasons urged, &#8220;but walking two or three turns, and pondering with himself, he told Lord Broghill the king would never forgive him the death of his father. His lordship desired him to employ somebody to sound the king in this matter, to see how he would take it, and offered himself to mediate in it for him. But Cromwell would not consent, but again repeated, &#8216;The king cannot and will not forgive the death of his father;&#8217; and so he left his lordship, who durst not tell him he had already dealt with his majesty in that affair. Upon this my lord withdrew, and meeting Cromwell&#8217;s wife and daughter, they inquired how he had succeeded; of which having given them an account, he added they must try their interest in him, but none could prevail.&#8221;<a href="#fnr1-1664-10-13">&#8617;</a></li>

After dinner my father and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4914/">the Court</a>, and there did all our business to my mind, as I have set down in a paper particularly expressing our proceedings at this court. So home, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1090/">W. Joyce</a> full of talk and pleased with his journey, and after supper I to bed and left my father, mother, and him laughing.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">My father</a> and I up and walked alone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/104/">Hinchingbroke</a>; and among the other late chargeable works that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord</a> hath done there, we saw his water-works and the Oral which is very fine; and so is the house all over, but I am sorry to think of the money at this time spent therein. Back to my father&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/118/">Mr. Sheply</a> being out of town) and there breakfasted, after making an end with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3196/">Barton</a> about his businesses, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> called me into the garden, and there but all to no purpose desiring me to be friends with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">John</a>, but I told her I cannot, nor indeed easily shall, which afflicted the poor woman, but I cannot help it. Then taking leave, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1090/">W. Joyce</a> and I set out, calling <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2784/">T. Trice</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3066/">Bugden</a>, and thence got by night to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3084/">Stevenage</a>, and there mighty merry, though I in bed more weary than the other two days, which, I think, proceeded from our galloping so much, my other weariness being almost all over; but I find that a coney skin in my breeches preserves me perfectly from galling, and that eating after I come to my Inne, without drinking, do keep me from being stomach sick, which drink do presently make me.</p>

<p>We lay all in several beds in the same room, and W. Joyce full of his impertinent tricks and talk, which then made us merry, as any other fool would have done. So to sleep.</p>

It raining, we set out, and about nine o&#8217;clock got to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2837/">Hatfield</a> in church-time; and I &#8217;light and saw my simple <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2838/">Lord Salsbury</a> sit there in his gallery. Staid not in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7952/">the Church</a>, but thence mounted again and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1780/">Barnett</a> by the end of sermon, and there dined at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7953/">Red Lyon</a> very weary again, but all my weariness yesterday night and to-day in my thighs only, the rest of my weariness in my shoulders and arms being quite gone.

		<p>Rose very well and not weary, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>; there did our business. I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Sir J. Lawson</a> since his return from sea first this morning, and hear that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> is come from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a> to town. Thence I to him, and finding him at my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/105/">Lord Crew&#8217;s</a>, I went with him home to his house and much kind discourse. Thence my Lord to Court, and I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and thence with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1044/">cook&#8217;s shop</a> and dined, discoursing and advising him about his great contract he is to make tomorrow, and do every day receive great satisfaction in his company, and a prospect of a just advantage by his friendship. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> doing some business, but it being very cold, I, for fear of getting cold, went early <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to bed, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> not being come home from my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/">Lady Jemimah</a>, with whom she hath been at a play and at Court to-day.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where among other things we made a very great contract with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> for 3,000 loade of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a>. At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>. In the afternoon to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">Fishery</a>, where, very confused and very ridiculous, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2937/">Lord Craven&#8217;s</a> proceedings, especially his finding fault with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6771/">Sir J. Collaton</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7963/">Colonell Griffin&#8217;s</a> report in the accounts of the lottery-men. Thence I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7821/">Mr. Gray</a> in his coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke</a> being abroad, we returned to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/243/">Somersett House</a>. In discourse I find him a very worthy and studious gentleman in the business of trade, and among-other things he observed well to me, how it is not the greatest wits, but the steady man, that is a good merchant: he instanced in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Ford</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Cocke</a>, the last of whom he values above all men as his oracle, as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> do <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7964/">Mr. Jolliffe</a>. He says that it is concluded among merchants, that where a trade hath once been and do decay, it never recovers again, and therefore that the manufacture of cloath of England will never come to esteem again; that, among other faults, Sir Richard Ford cannot keepe a secret, and that it is so much the part of a merchant to be guilty of that fault that the Duke of Yoke is resolved to commit no more secrets to the merchants of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7105/">the Royall Company</a>; that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7163/">Sir Ellis Layton</a> is, for a speech of forty words, the wittiest man that ever he knew in his life, but longer he is nothing, his judgment being nothing at all, but his wit most absolute. At Somersett House he carried me in, and there I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1399/">the Queene&#8217;s</a> new rooms, which are most stately and nobly furnished; and there I saw her, and the Duke of Yorke and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1402/">Duchesse</a> were there. The Duke espied me, and came to me, and talked with me a very great while about our contract this day with Sir W. Warren, and among other things did with some contempt ask whether we did except <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7965/">Polliards</a>, which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> did yesterday (in spite, as the Duke I believe by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/">Lord Barkely</a> do well enough know) among other things in writing propose.</p>

<p>Thence home by coach, it raining hard, and to my office, where late, then home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This night the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7626/">Dutch Embassador</a> desired and had an audience of the King. What the issue of it was I know not. Both sides I believe desire peace, but neither will begin, and so I believe a warr will follow. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">The Prince</a> is with his fleet at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>, and the Dutch are making all preparations for warr.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> all the morning. At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>; then abroad by coach to buy for the office <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7966/">&#8220;Herne upon the Statute of Charitable Uses,&#8221;</a> in order to the doing something better in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5019/">the Chest</a> than we have done, for I am ashamed to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> possess himself so long of so much money as he hath done. Coming home, weighed, my two silver flaggons at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1537/">Stevens&#8217;s</a>. They weigh 212 oz. 27 dwt., which is about 50<i>l.</i>, at 5<i>s.</i> per oz., and then they judge the fashion to be worth above 5<i>s.</i> per oz. more &#8212; nay, some say 10<i>s.</i> an ounce the fashion. But I do not believe, but yet am sorry to see that the fashion is worth so much, and the silver come to no more.</p>

<p>So home and to my office, where very busy late. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">My wife</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7967/">Mercer&#8217;s mother&#8217;s</a>, I believe, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> with them, which I do not like, that he should ask my leave to go about business, and then to go and spend his time in sport, and leave me here busy. To supper and to bed, my wife coming in by and by, which though I know there was no hurt in it; I do not like.</p>

At noon my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2542/">uncle Thomas</a> came, dined with me, and received some money of me. Then I to my office, where I took in with me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell&#8217;s wife</a>, and there I caressed her, and find her every day more and more coming with good words and promises of getting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6479/">her husband</a> a place, which I will do. So we parted, and I to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> at his lodgings, and after a little stay away with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Mr. Cholmely</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleete Streete</a>; in the way he telling me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> is like to be in a bad condition with this same <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5385/">Fitzgerald</a>, he being a man of no honour, nor presence, nor little honesty, and endeavours: to raise the Irish and suppress the English interest there; and offend every body, and do nothing that I hear of well, which I am sorry for.</p>

<p>Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, by the way taking two silver tumblers home, which I have bought, and so home, and there late busy at my office, and then home to supper and to bed.</p>

Turner&#8217;s</a>, and there bought my cloth, coloured, for a suit and cloake, to line with plush the cloak, which will cost me money, but I find that I must go handsomely, whatever it costs me, and the charge will be made up in the fruit it brings.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7944/">the Coffee-house</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">&#8217;Change</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the afternoon, whither comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/549/">W. Howe</a> to see me, being come from, and going presently back to sea with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">my Lord</a>. Among other things he tells me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Mr. Creed</a> is much out of favour with my Lord from his freedom of talke and bold carriage, and other things with which my Lord is not pleased, but most I doubt his not lending my Lord money, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/340/">Mr. Moore&#8217;s</a> reporting what his answer was I doubt in the worst manner. But, however, a very unworthy rogue he is, and, therefore, let him go for one good for nothing, though wise to the height above most men I converse with.</p>

<p>In the evening (W. Howe being gone) comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">Mr. Martin</a>, to trouble me again to get him a Lieutenant&#8217;s place for which he is as fit as a foole can be. But I put him off like an arse, as he is, and so setting my papers and books in order: I home to supper and to bed.</p>

Warren</a> against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, wherein the Duke is very earnest for our contracting.</p>

<p>Thence home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> till noon, and then dined and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and off with Sir W.

Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">a Committee</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, where I had the good lucke to speak something to very good purpose about the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5384/">Mole</a> at Tangier, which was well received even by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Sir J. Lawson</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Mr. Cholmely</a>, the undertakers, against whose interest I spoke; that I believe I shall be valued for it. Thence into the galleries to talk with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a>; among other things, about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">the Prince&#8217;s</a> writing up to tell us of the danger he and his fleete lie in at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>, of receiving affronts from the Dutch; which, my Lord said, he would never have done, had he lain there with one ship alone: nor is there any great reason for it, because of the sands. However, the fleete will be ordered to go and lay themselves up at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7979/">Cowes</a>. Much beneath the prowesse of the Prince, I think, and the honour of the nation, at the first to be found to secure themselves. My Lord is well pleased to think, that, if the Duke and the Prince go, all the blame of any miscarriage will not light on him; and that if any thing goes well, he hopes he shall have the share of the glory, for the Prince is by no means well esteemed of by any body.</p>

<p>Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and though not very well yet up late about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">the Fishery</a> business, wherein I hope to give an account how I find the Collections to have been managed, which I did finish to my great content, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This day the great <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5017/">O&#8217;Neale</a> died; I believe, to the content of all the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7980/">Protestant</a> pretenders in Ireland.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning, and finished <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren&#8217;s</a> great contract for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a>, with great content to me, because just in the terms I wrote last night to Sir W. Warren and against the terms proposed by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>.</p>

<p>At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and there found <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/208/">Hawley</a>. After dinner comes in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7981/">Mrs. Ingram</a>, the first time to make a visit to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>. After a little stay I left them and to the Committee of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">the Fishery</a>, and there did make my report of the late public collections for the Fishery, much to the satisfaction of the Committee, and I think much to my reputation, for good notice was taken of it and much it was commended.</p>

<p>So home, in my way taking care of a piece of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/">plate</a> for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1809/">Mr. Christopher Pett</a>, against the launching of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5177/">his new great ship</a> tomorrow at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>, which I singly did move to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">His Royall Highness</a>, and did obtain it for him, to the value of twenty pieces. And he, under his hand, do acknowledge to me that he did never receive so great a kindness from any man in the world as from me herein. So to my office, and then to supper, and then to my office again, where busy late, being very full now a days of business to my great content, I thank God, and so home to bed, my house being full of a design, to go to-morrow, my wife and all her servants, to see the new ship launched.</p>

		<p>Up, my people rising mighty betimes, to fit themselves to go by water; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a>, he could not sleep, but wakes about four o&#8217;clock, and in bed lay playing on his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/540/">lute</a> till daylight, and, it seems, did the like last night till twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>About eight o&#8217;clock, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, she and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">her woman</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6788/">Besse</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7583/">Jane</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> and the boy, to the water-side, and there took boat, and by and by I out of doors, to look after the flaggon, to get it ready to carry to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>.</p>

<p>That being not ready, I stepped aside and found out <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7983/">Nellson</a>, he that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6293/">Whistler</a> buys his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6059/">bewpers</a> of, and did there buy 5 pieces at their price, and am in hopes thereby to bring them down or buy ourselves all we spend of Nellson at the first hand.</p>

<p>This jobb was greatly to my content, and by and by the flaggon being finished at the burnisher&#8217;s, I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there fitted myself, and took a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/575/">hackney-coach</a> I hired, it being a very cold and foule day, to Woolwich, all the way reading in a good book touching the fishery, and that being done, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7966/">the book upon the statute of charitable uses</a>, mightily to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>At Woolwich; I there up to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke</a>, and they liked the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7982/">plate</a> well. Here I staid above with them while <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5177/">the ship</a> was launched, which was done with great success, and the King did very much like the ship, saying, she had the best bow that ever he saw.</p>

<p>But, Lord! the sorry talke and discourse among the great courtiers round about him, without any reverence in the world, but with so much disorder.</p>

<p>By and by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2381/">the Queene</a> comes and her Mayds of Honour; one whereof, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7984/">Mrs. Boynton</a>, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5787/">Duchesse of Buckingham</a>, had been very siclee coming by water in the barge (the water being very rough); but what silly sport they made with them in very common terms, methought, was very poor, and below what people think these great people say and do.</p>

<p>The launching being done, the King and company went down to take barge; and I sent for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1809/">Mr. Pett</a>, and put the flaggon into the Duke&#8217;s hand, and he, in the presence of the King, did give it, Mr. Pett taking it upon his knee. This Mr. Pett is wholly beholding to me for, and he do know and I believe will acknowledge it.</p>

<p>Thence I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/814/">Mr. Ackworth</a>, and there eat and drank with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/">Commissioner Pett</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1791/">his wife</a>, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5055/">Shelden&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">his Lady</a> were. By and by I took coach after I had enquired for my wife or her boat, but found none. Going out of the gate, an ordinary woman prayed me to give her room to London, which I did, but spoke not to her all the way, but read, as long as I could see, my book again.</p>

<p>Dark when we came to London, and a stop of coaches in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1284/">Southwarke</a>. I staid above half an houre and then &#8217;light, and finding Sir W. Batten&#8217;s coach, heard they were gone into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1283/">the Beare</a> at the Bridge foot, and thither I to them. Presently the stop is removed, and then going out to find my coach, I could not find it, for it was gone with the rest; so I fair to go through the darke and dirt over the bridge, and my leg fell in a hole broke on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">the bridge</a>, but, the constable standing there to keep people from it, I was catched up, otherwise I had broke my leg; for which mercy the Lord be praised! So at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1075/">Fanchurch</a> I found my coach staying for me, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">the little girle</a> hath looked to the house well, but no wife come home, which made me begin to fear [for] her, the water being very rough, and cold and darke. But by and by she and her company come in all well, at which I was glad, though angry.</p>

<p>Thence I to Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, and there sat late with him, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir R. Ford</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1156/">Sir John Robinson</a>; the last of whom continues still the same foole he was, crying up what power he has in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, in knowing their temper, and being able to do what he will with them. It seems the City did last night very freely lend the King 100,000<i>l.</i> without any security but the King&#8217;s word, which was very noble. But this loggerhead and Sir R. Ford would make us believe that they did it. Now Sir R. Ford is a cunning man, and makes a foole of the other, and the other believes whatever the other tells him. But, Lord! to think that such a man should be Lieutenant of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>, and so great a man as he is, is a strange thing to me.</p>

<p>With them late and then home and with my wife to bed, after supper.</p>

So with great content <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to my office, where late, and having got a great cold in my head yesterday home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Slept ill all night, having got a very great cold the other day at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a> in [my] head, which makes me full of snot. Up in the morning, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7408/">my tailor</a> brings me home my fine, new, coloured cloth suit, my cloake lined with plush, as good a suit as ever I wore in my life, and mighty neat, to my great content.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and there all the morning. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7983/">Nellson&#8217;s</a>, and there bought 20 pieces more of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6059/">Bewpers</a>, and hope to go on with him to a contract.

All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. At dinner at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>. In the afternoon to the office again, and about 9 o&#8217;clock by appointment to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7987/">King&#8217;s Head</a> tavern upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/175/">Fish Street Hill</a>, whither <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7989/">Mr. Wolfe</a> (and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5674/">Parham</a> by his means) met me to discourse about the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7696/">Fishery</a>, and great light I had by Parham, who is a little conceited, but a very knowing man in his way, and in the general fishing trade of England.</p>

<p>Here I staid three hours, and eat a barrel of very fine <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/">oysters</a> of Wolfe&#8217;s giving me, and so, it raining hard, home and to my office, and then home to bed.</p>

<p>All the talke is that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7463/">De Ruyter</a> is come over-land home with six or eight of his captaines to command here at home, and their ships kept abroad in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3260/">the Straights</a>; which sounds as if they had a mind to do something with us.</p>

One of them he calls to mind was by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8001/">Sir Toby Bridges</a>. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; says he, &#8220;there is a very good man.

<p>So late to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> and there till past one in the morning making up my month&#8217;s accounts, and find that my expense this month in clothes has kept me from laying up anything; but I am no worse, but a little better than I was, which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">is 1205<i>l.</i></a>, a great sum, the Lord be praised for it!</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to bed, with my mind full of content therein, and vexed for my being so angry in bad words to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to-night, she not giving me a good account of her layings out to my mind to-night.</p>

<p>This day I hear young <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8002/">Mr. Stanly</a>, a brave young [gentleman], that went out with young <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1708/">Jermin</a>, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a>, is already dead of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/363/">small-pox</a>, at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>.</p>
