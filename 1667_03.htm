		<p>Up, it being very cold weather again after a good deal of warm summer weather, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where I settled to do much business to-day. By and by sent for to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> to discourse of the business of the Navy, and our wants, and the best way of bestowing the little money we have, which is about 30,000<i>l.</i>, but, God knows, we have need of ten times as much, which do make my life uncomfortable, I confess, on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> behalf, though it is well enough as to my own particular, but the King&#8217;s service is undone by it. Having done with him, back again to the office, and in the streets, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3333/">Mark Lane</a>, I do observe, it being <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10903/">St. David&#8217;s day</a>, the picture of a man dressed like a Welchman, hanging by the neck upon one of the poles that stand out at the top of one of the merchants&#8217; houses, in full proportion, and very handsomely done; which is one of the oddest sights I have seen a good while, for it was so like a man that one would have thought it was indeed a man.<sup id="fnr1-1667-03-01"><a href="#fn1-1667-03-01">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Being returned <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10889/">Greeting</a>, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/783/">flageolet</a>-master, come, and teaching <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>; and I do think my wife will take pleasure in it, and it will be easy for her, and pleasant. So I, as I am well content with the charge it will occasion me.</p>

<p>So to the office till dinner-time, and then home to dinner, and before dinner making my wife to sing. Poor wretch! her ear is so bad that it made me angry, till the poor wretch cried to see me so vexed at her, that I think I shall not discourage her so much again, but will endeavour to make her understand sounds, and do her good that way; for she hath a great mind to learn, only to please me; and, therefore, I am mighty unjust to her in discouraging her so much, but we were good friends, and to dinner, and had she not been ill with those and that it were not Friday (on which in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/469/">Lent</a> there are no plays) I had carried her to a play, but she not being fit to go abroad, I to the office, where all the afternoon close examining the collection of my papers of the accounts of the Navy since this war to my great content, and so at night home to talk and sing with my-wife, and then to supper and so to bed with great pleasure. But I cannot but remember that just before dinner one of my people come up to me, and told me a man come from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1670/">Huntingdon</a> would speak with me, how my heart come into my mouth doubting that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a>, who has been long sicke, was dead. It put me into a trembling, but, blessed be [God]! it was no such thing, but a countryman come about ordinary business to me, to receive 50<i>l.</i> paid to my father in the country for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6215/">Perkins&#8217;s</a> for their legacy, upon the death of their mother, by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/884/">my uncle&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3384/">will</a>. So though I get nothing at present, at least by the estate, I am fain to pay this money rather than rob my father, and much good may it do them that I may have no more further trouble from them.</p>

<p>I hear to-day that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10904/">Tom Woodall</a>, the known chyrurgeon, is killed at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/243/">Somerset House</a> by a Frenchman, but the occasion <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> could not tell me.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where sitting all the morning, and among other things did agree upon a distribution of 30,000<i>l.</i> and odd, which is the only sum we hear of like to come out of all the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10745/">Poll Bill</a> for the use of this office for buying of goods. I did herein some few courtesies for particular friends I wished well to, and for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> service also, and was therefore well pleased with what was done. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> this day did bring an order from the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> for our receiving from him a small vessel for a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10129/">fireship</a>, and taking away a better of the King&#8217;s for it, it being expressed for his great service to the King. This I am glad of, not for his sake, but that it will give me a better ground, I believe, to ask something for myself of this kind, which I was fearful to begin. This do make Sir W. Pen the most kind to me that can be. I suppose it is this, lest it should find any opposition from me, but I will not oppose, but promote it.</p>

<p>After dinner, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/475/">King&#8217;s house</a> to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10905/">&#8220;The Mayden Queene,&#8221;</a> a new play of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7233/">Dryden&#8217;s</a>, mightily commended for the regularity of it, and the strain and wit; and, the truth is, there is a comical part done by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5037/">Nell</a>,<sup id="fnr1-1667-03-02"><a href="#fn1-1667-03-02">1</a></sup> which is Florimell, that I never can hope ever to see the like done again, by man or woman. The King and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> were at the play. But so great performance of a comical part was never, I believe, in the world before as Nell do this, both as a mad girle, then most and best of all when she comes in like a young gallant; and hath the notions and carriage of a spark the most that ever I saw any man have. It makes me, I confess, admire her. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to the office, where busy a while, and then home to read the lives of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10906/">Henry 5th</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10907/">6th</a>, very fine, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10379/">Speede</a>, and to bed. This day I did pay a bill of 50<i>l.</i> from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a>, being so much out of my own purse gone to pay my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/884/">uncle Robert&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3384/">legacy</a> to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6215/">aunt Perkins&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2812/">child</a>.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1667/03/03/">Sunday 3 March 1666/67</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Lay long, merrily talking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and then up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, where a dull sermon of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1215/">Mr. Mills</a> touching Original Sin, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there find little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">his wife</a>, whom I love mightily. Mightily contented I was in their company, for I love her much; and so after dinner I left them and by water from the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1326/">Old Swan</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where, walking in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6451/">galleries</a>, I in the first place met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Mr. Pierce</a>, who tells me the story of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10904/">Tom Woodall</a>, the surgeon, killed in a drunken quarrel, and how the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> hath a mind to get him [Pierce] one of his places in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10908/">St. Thomas&#8217;s Hospitall</a>. Then comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10909/">Mr. Hayward</a>, the Duke of York&#8217;s servant, and tells us that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/963/">the Swede&#8217;s Embassador</a> hath been here to-day with news that it is believed that the Dutch will yield to have the treaty at London or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/646/">Dover</a>, neither of which will get <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">our King</a> any credit, we having already consented to have it at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/782/">The Hague</a>; which, it seems, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8718/">De Witt</a> opposed, as a thing wherein the King of England must needs have some profound design, which in my conscience he hath not. They do also tell me that newes is this day come to the King, that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> is come with his army to the frontiers of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/">Flanders</a>, demanding leave to pass through their country towards Poland, but is denied, and thereupon that he is gone into the country. How true this is I dare not believe till I hear more.</p>

<p>From them I walked into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Parke</a>, it being a fine but very cold day; and there took two or three turns the length of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1126/">Pell Mell</a>: and there I met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10910/">Serjeant Bearcroft</a>, who was sent for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a>, to have brought him prisoner to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>. He come to towne this day, and brings word that, being overtaken and outrid by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5787/">Duchesse of Buckingham</a> within a few miles of the Duke&#8217;s house of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10911/">Westhorp</a>, he believes she got thither about a quarter of an hour before him, and so had time to consider; so that, when he come, the doors were kept shut against him. The next day, coming with officers of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10915/">neighbour market-town</a> to force open the doors, they were open for him, but the Duke gone; so he took horse presently, and heard upon the road that the Duke of Buckingham was gone before him for London: so that he believes he is this day also come to towne before him; but no newes is yet heard of him. This is all he brings. Thence to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor&#8217;s</a>, and there, meeting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, he and I walked in my Lord&#8217;s garden, and talked; among other things, of the treaty: and he says there will certainly be a peace, but I cannot believe it. He tells me that the Duke of Buckingham his crimes, as far as he knows, are his being of a caball with some discontented persons of the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">House of Commons</a>, and opposing the desires of the King in all his matters in that House; and endeavouring to become popular, and advising how the Commons&#8217; House should proceed, and how he would order the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/293/">House of Lords</a>. And that he hath been endeavouring to have the King&#8217;s nativity calculated; which was done, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/14138/">the fellow</a> now in the Tower about it; which itself hath heretofore, as he says, been held treason, and people died for it; but by the Statute of Treasons, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10916/">Queen Mary&#8217;s</a> times and since, it hath been left out. He tells me that this silly Lord hath provoked, by his ill-carriage, the Duke of York, my Lord Chancellor, and all the great persons; and therefore, most likely, will die. He tells me, too, many practices of treachery against this King; as betraying him in Scotland, and giving <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/796/">Oliver</a> an account of the King&#8217;s private councils; which the King knows very well, and hath yet pardoned him.<sup id="fnr1-1667-03-03"><a href="#fn1-1667-03-03">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here I passed away a little time more talking with him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, whom I met there, and so away, Creed walking with me to White Hall, and there I took water and stayed at Michell&#8217;s to drink. I home, and there to read very good things in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/806/">Fuller&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1752/">&#8220;Church History,&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1841/">&#8220;Worthies,&#8221;</a> and so to supper, and after supper had much good discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a>, who supped with us, about the ticket office and the knaveries and extortions every day used there, and particularly of the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Mr. Carcasse</a>, whom I fear I shall find a very rogue. So parted with him, and then to bed.</p>

		<p>Two of our greatest poets have drawn the character of the Duke of Buckingham in brilliant verse, and both have condemned him to infamy. There is enough in Pepys&#8217;s reports to corroborate the main features of Dryden&#8217;s magnificent portrait of Zimri in &#8220;Absolom and Achitophel&#8221;:</p>

		 <blockquote>
			<p>In the first rank of these did Zimri stand; A man so various that he seemed to be Not one, but all mankind&#8217;s epitome; Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong; Was everything by starts, and nothing long,</p>

		 	<p>But, in the course of one revolving moon, Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon; Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking, Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking, * * * * * * * He laughed himself from Court, then sought relief By forming parties, but could ne&#8217;er be chief.</p>
		</blockquote>

	 <p>Pope&#8217;s facts are not correct, and hence the effect of his picture is impaired. In spite of the duke&#8217;s constant visits to the Tower, Charles II. still continued his friend; but on the death of the king, expecting little from James, he retired to his estate at Helmsley, in Yorkshire, to nurse his property and to restore his constitution. He died on April 16th, 1687, at Kirkby Moorside, after a few days&#8217; illness, caused by sitting on the damp grass when heated from a fox chase. The scene of his death was the house of a tenant, not &#8220;the worst inn&#8217;s worst room&#8221; (Moral Essays,&#8221; epist. iii.). He was buried in Westminster Abbey. <a href="#fnr1-1667-03-03">&#8617;</a></p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">[Sir] W. Batten</a> by barge to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> by eight in the morning, where to the King&#8217;s yard a little to look after business there, and then to a private storehouse to look upon some cordage of Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, and there being a hole formerly made for a drain for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6371/">tarr</a> to run into, wherein the barrel stood still, full of stinking water, Sir W. Batten did fall with one leg into it, which might have been very bad to him by breaking a leg or other hurt, but, thanks be to God, he only sprained his foot a little. So after his shifting his stockings at a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10924/">strong water</a> shop close by, we took barge again, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>, where our business was chiefly to look upon the ballast wharfe there, which is offered us for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> use to hire, but we do not think it worth the laying out much money upon, unless we could buy the fee-simple of it, which cannot be sold us, so we wholly flung it off. So to the Dockyard, and there staid a while talking about business of the yard, and thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5129/">Rope-yard</a>, and so to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5128/">White Hart</a> and there dined, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> with us, whom we found at the Rope-yard, and very merry at dinner, and many pretty tales of Sir J. Minnes, which I have entered in my tale book. But by this time Sir W. Batten was come to be in much pain in his foot, so as he was forced to be carried down in a chair to the barge again, and so away to Deptford, and there I a little in the yard, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6479/">Bagwell&#8217;s</a>, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">his wife</a> washing, and also I did &#8216;hazer tout que je voudrais con&#8217; her, and then sent for her husband, and discoursed of his going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a> this week to his charge of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9944/">the new ship</a> building there, which I have got him, and so away, walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>, and there took boat and away home, and upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/">Tower Hill</a>, near the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">ticket</a> office, meeting with my old acquaintance <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/990/">Mr. Chaplin</a>, the cheesemonger, and there fell to talk of news, and he tells me that for certain the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> is denied passage with his army through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/">Flanders</a>, and that he hears that the Dutch do stand upon high terms with us, and will have a promise of not being obliged to strike the flag to us before they will treat with us, and other high things, which I am ashamed of and do hope will never be yielded to. That they do make all imaginable preparations, but that he believes they will be in mighty want of men; that the King of France do court us mightily. He tells me too that our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord-Treasurer</a> is going to lay down, and that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> is to be Lord Treasurer, but I believe nothing of it, for he is not yet of estate visible enough to have the charge I suppose upon him. So being parted from him I home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and after having done business there I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to supper, and there mightily pleased with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> beginning the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/783/">flagellette</a>, believing that she will come to very well thereon. This day in the barge I took <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3729/">Berckenshaw&#8217;s</a> translation of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10925/">Alsted</a> his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10926/">Templum</a>, but the most ridiculous book, as he has translated it, that ever I saw in my life, I declaring that I understood not three lines together from one end of the book to the other.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where met and sat all the morning, doing little for want of money, but only bear the countenance of an office. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then to the office again, and there comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">Martin</a> my purser, and I walked with him awhile in the garden, I giving him good advice to beware of coming any more with high demands for supernumeraries or other things, for now <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> is come to mind the business, the passing of his accounts will not be so easy as the last. He tells me he will never need it again, it being as easy, and to as much purpose to do the same thing otherwise, and how he do keep his Captain&#8217;s table, and by that means hath the command of his Captains, and do not fear in a 5th-rate ship constantly employed to get a 1000<i>l.</i> in five years time, and this year, besides all his spendings, which are I fear high, he hath got at this day clear above 150<i>l.</i> in a voyage of about five or six months, which is a brave trade.</p>

<p>He gone I to the office, and there all the afternoon late doing much business, and then to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, whose leg is all but better than it was, and like to do well. I by discourse do perceive he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">his Lady</a> are to their hearts out with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8925/">Mrs. Williams</a>, to which I added something, but, I think, did not venture too far with them. But, Lord! to see to what a poor content any acquaintance among these people, or the people of the world, as they now-adays go, is worth; for my part I and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> will keep to one another and let the world go hang, for there is nothing but falseness in it. So home to supper and hear my wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">girle</a> sing a little, and then to bed with much content of mind.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> by coach, and by the way agreed to acquaint <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">[Sir] W. Coventry</a> with the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Mr. Carcasse</a>, and he and I spoke to Sir W. Coventry that we might move it to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, which I did in a very indifferent, that is, impartial manner, but vexed I believe <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>. Here the Duke of York did acquaint us, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> did the like also, afterwards coming in, with his resolution of altering the manner of the war this year; that is, we shall keep what fleete we have abroad in several squadrons: so that now all is come out; but we are to keep it as close as we can, without hindering the work that is to be done in preparation to this. Great preparations there are to fortify <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/">Sheernesse</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4138/">the yard</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>, and forces are drawing down to both those places, and elsewhere by the seaside; so that we have some fear of an invasion; and the Duke of York himself did declare his expectation of the enemy&#8217;s blocking us up here in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a>, and therefore directed that we should send away all the ships that we have to fit out hence. Sir W. Pen told me, going with me this morning to White Hall, that for certain the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a> is brought into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>, and that he hath had an hour&#8217;s private conference with the King before he was sent thither.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>. There bought some news books, and, as every where else, hear every body complain of the dearness of coals, being at 4<i>l.</i> per <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7747/">chaldron</a>, the weather, too, being become most bitter cold, the King saying to-day that it was the coldest day he ever knew in England. Thence by coach to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/105/">Lord Crew&#8217;s</a>, where very welcome. Here I find they are in doubt where the Duke of Buckingham is; which makes me mightily reflect on the uncertainty of all history, when, in a business of this moment, and of this day&#8217;s growth, we cannot tell the truth. Here dined my old acquaintance, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1556/">Mr. Borfett</a>, that was my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a> chaplain, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/931/">Lady Wright</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10929/">Dr. Boreman</a>, who is preacher at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1009/">St. Gyles&#8217;s in the Fields</a>, who, after dinner, did give my Lord an account of two <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/306/">papist</a> women lately converted, whereof one wrote her recantation, which he shewed under her own hand mighty well drawn, so as my Lord desired a copy of it, after he had satisfied himself from the Doctor, that to his knowledge she was not a woman under any necessity. Thence by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and staid a very little, and then by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>, and walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell&#8217;s</a>, where &#8216;la moher&#8217; was &#8216;defro, sed&#8217; would not have me &#8216;demeurer&#8217; there &#8216;parce que&#8217; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7788/">Mrs. Batters</a> and one of my &#8216;ancillas&#8217;, I believe Jane (for she was gone abroad to-day), was in the town, and coming thither; so I away presently, esteeming it a great escape. So to the yard and spoke a word or two, and then by water home, wondrous cold, and reading <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10930/">a ridiculous ballad</a> made in praise of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, to the tune of St. George, the tune being printed, too; and I observe that people have some great encouragement to make ballads of him of this kind. There are so many, that hereafter he will sound like <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10931/">Guy of Warwicke</a>. Then abroad with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, leaving her at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, while I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly&#8217;s</a>, a pretty house, and a fine, worthy, well-disposed gentleman he is. He and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke&#8217;s</a>, about money for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, but to little purpose. H. Cholmley tells me, among other things, that he hears of little hopes of a peace, their demands being so high as we shall never grant, and could tell me that we shall keep no fleete abroad this year, but only squadrons. And, among other things, that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, he believes, will lose his command of Tangier by his corrupt covetous ways of endeavouring to sell his command, which I am glad [of], for he is a man of no worth in the world but compliment. So to the &#8217;Change, and there bought 32<i>s.</i> worth of things for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Mrs. Knipp</a>, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/312/">Valentine</a>, which is pretty to see how my wife is come to convention with me, that, whatever I do give to anybody else, I shall give her as much, which I am not much displeased with. So home and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, to tell him what I had done to-day about Carcasse&#8217;s business, and God forgive me I am not without design to give a blow to Sir W. Batten by it. So home, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10208/">Mr. Batelier</a> supped with us and talked away the evening pretty late, and so he gone and we to bed.</p>

		<p>So up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, my head full of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Carcasse&#8217;s</a> business; then hearing that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a> is at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">my house</a>, I home, and it was about a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">ticket</a> for a friend of hers. I do love the humour of the jade very well. So to the office again, not being able to stay, and there about noon my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> did begin to talk of Carcasse&#8217;s business. Only <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/">Commissioner Pett</a>, my Lord, and I there, and it was pretty to see how Pett hugged the occasion of having anything against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, which I am not much troubled at, for I love him not neither. Though I did really endeavour to quash it all I could, because I would prevent their malice taking effect. My Lord I see is fully resolved to vindicate Carcasse, though to the undoing of Sir W. Batten, but I believe he will find himself in a mistake, and do himself no good, and that I shall be glad of, for though I love the treason I hate the traitor. But he is vexed at my moving it to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> yesterday, which I answered well, so as I think he could not answer. But, Lord! it is pretty to see how Pett hugs this business, and how he favours my Lord Bruncker; who to my knowledge hates him, and has said more to his disadvantage, in my presence, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and Duke of York than any man in England, and so let them thrive one with another by cheating one another, for that is all I observe among them. Thence home late, and find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> hath dined, and she and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1161/">Mrs. Hewer</a> going to a play. Here was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, and he and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10932/">Devonshire House</a>, to a burial of a kinsman of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir R. Viner&#8217;s</a>; and there I received a ring, and so away presently to Creed, who staid for me at an alehouse hard by, and thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2935/">Duke&#8217;s playhouse</a>, where he parted, and I in and find my wife and Mrs. Hewer, and sat by them and saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10933/">&#8220;The English Princesse, or Richard the Third;&#8221;</a> a most sad, melancholy play, and pretty good; but nothing eminent in it, as some tragedys are; only little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9899/">Mis. Davis</a> did dance a jig after the end of the play, and there telling the next day&#8217;s play; so that it come in by force only to please the company to see her dance in boy&#8217;s clothes; and, the truth is, there is no comparison between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5037/">Nell&#8217;s</a> dancing the other day at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/475/">King&#8217;s house</a> in boy&#8217;s clothes and this, this being infinitely beyond the other. Here was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1153/">Mrs. Clerke</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Pierce</a>, to whom one word only of &#8220;How do you,&#8221; and so away home, Mrs. Hewer with us, and I to the office and so to [Sir] W. Batten&#8217;s, and there talked privately with him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> about business of Carcasse against tomorrow, wherein I think I did give them proof enough of my ability as well as friendship to [Sir] W. Batten, and the honour of the office, in my sense of the rogue&#8217;s business. So back to finish my office business, and then home to supper, and to bed.</p>

<p>This day, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2214/">Commissioner Taylor</a> come to me for advice, and would force me to take ten pieces in gold of him, which I had no mind to, he being become one of our number at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/482/">the Board</a>.</p>

<p>This day was reckoned by all people the coldest day that ever was remembered in England; and, God knows! coals at a very great price.</p>

		<p>Up, and to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>, where drank at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Michell&#8217;s</a>, but not seeing her whom I love I by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there acquainted <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G.

Longs</a> office, and strange it is to see what horrid delays there are at this day in the business of money, there being nothing yet come from my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a> to set the business of money in action since the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> broke off, notwithstanding the greatness and number of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> occasions for it. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, and there had three or four baisers of the little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">ancilla</a> there, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, where I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">Mr. Martin</a>, the purser, come through with a picture in his hand, which he had bought, and observed how all the people of the Hall did fleer and laugh upon him, crying, &#8220;There is plenty grown upon a sudden;&#8221; and, the truth is, I was a little troubled that my favour should fall on so vain a fellow as he, and the more because, methought, the people do gaze upon me as the man that had raised him, and as if they guessed whence my kindness to him springs.</p>

<p>So thence to White Hall, where I find all met at the Duke of York&#8217;s chamber; and, by and by, the Duke of York comes, and Carcasse is called in, and I read the depositions and his answers, and he added with great confidence and good words, even almost to persuasion, what to say; and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, like a very silly solicitor, argued against me and us all for him; and, being asked first by the Duke of York his opinion, did give it for his being excused. I next did answer the contrary very plainly, and had, in this dispute, which vexed and will never be forgot by my Lord, many occasions of speaking severely, and did, against his bad practices. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/">Commissioner Pett</a>, like a fawning rogue, sided with my Lord, but to no purpose; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a>, like a cunning rogue, spoke mighty indifferently, and said nothing in all the fray, like a knave as he is. But <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">[Sir] W. Batten</a> spoke out, and did come off himself by the Duke&#8217;s kindness very well; and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and Sir W. Coventry, and the Duke of York himself, flatly as I said; and so he was declared unfit to continue in, and therefore to be presently discharged the office; which, among other good effects, I hope, will make my Lord Bruncker not &#8216;alloquer&#8217; so high, when he shall consider he hath had such a publick foyle as this is. So home with [Sir] W. Batten, and [Sir] W. Pen, by coach, and there met at the office, and my Lord Bruncker presently after us, and there did give order to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1019/">Mr. Stevens</a> for securing the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">tickets</a> in Carcasses hands, which my Lord against his will could not refuse to sign, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and so away with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> by coach, she to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce&#8217;s</a> and I to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, and with him to [my] <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, where by agreement we met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, and there sat and talked all the afternoon almost about one thing or other, expecting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke&#8217;s</a> coming, but he come not, so we away towards night, Sir H. Cholmly and I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">Temple</a>, and there parted, telling me of my Lord Bellasses&#8217;s want of generosity, and that he [Bellasses] will certainly be turned out of his government, and he thinks himself stands fair for it. So home, and there found, as I expected, Mrs. Pierce and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10208/">Mr. Batelier</a>; he went for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9995/">Mrs. Jones</a>, but no <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Mrs. Knipp</a> come, which vexed me, nor any other company. So with one fidler we danced away the evening, but I was not well contented with the littleness of the room, and my wife&#8217;s want of preparing things ready, as they should be, for supper, and bed. So not very merry, though very well pleased. So after supper to bed, my wife and Mrs. Pierce, and her boy <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9472/">James</a> and I. Yesterday I began to make this mark (V) stand instead of three pricks, which therefore I must observe every where, it being a mark more easy to make.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where sat all the morning busy. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce</a> did continue with us and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9472/">her boy</a> (who I still find every day more and more witty beyond his age), and did dine with us, and by and by comes in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">her husband</a> and a brother-in-law of his, a parson, one of the tallest biggest men that ever I saw in my life. So to the office, where a meeting extraordinary about settling the number and wages of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker&#8217;s</a> clerks for his new work upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">the Treasurer&#8217;s</a> accounts, but this did put us upon running into the business of yesterday about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Carcasse</a>, wherein I perceive he is most dissatisfied with me, and I am not sorry for it, having all the world but him of my side therein, for it will let him know another time that he is not to expect our submitting to him in every thing, as I think he did heretofore expect. He did speak many severe words to me, and I returned as many to him, so that I do think there cannot for a great while, be, any right peace between us, and I care not a fart for it; but however, I must look about me and mind my business, for I perceive by his threats and enquiries he is and will endeavour to find out something against me or mine. Breaking up here somewhat brokenly I home, and carried Mrs. Pierce and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">wife</a> to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, and there did give her and myself a pair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a>, and then set her down at home, and so back again straight home and thereto do business, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> and others, and mighty merry, only I have got a great cold, and the scolding this day at the office with my Lord Bruncker hath made it worse, that I am not able to speak. But, Lord! to see how kind Sir W. Batten and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">his Lady</a> are to me upon this business of my standing by [Sir] W. Batten against Carcasse, and I am glad of it. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a>, who was here to-night, did tell us that he is certain that yesterday a proclamation was voted at the Council, touching the proclaiming of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Lord Duke of Buckingham</a> a traytor, and that it will be out on Monday. So home late, and drank some buttered <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/450/">ale</a>, and so to bed and to sleep. This cold did most certainly come by my staying a little too long bare-legged yesterday morning when I rose while I looked out fresh socks and thread <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/516/">stockings</a>, yesterday&#8217;s having in the night, lying near the window, been covered with snow within the window, which made me I durst not put them on.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Having my cold still grown more upon me, so as I am not able to speak, I lay in bed till noon, and then up and to my chamber with a good fire, and there spent an hour on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10941/">Morly&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10942/">Introduction to Musique</a>, a very good but unmethodical book. Then to dinner, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I, and then all the afternoon alone in my chamber preparing a letter for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2214/">Commissioner Taylor</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> about getting his accounts for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8412/">The Loyal London</a>, by him built for them, stated and discharged, they owing him still about 4000<i>l.</i>. Towards the evening comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1060/">Mr. Spong</a> to see me, whose discourse about several things I proposed to him was very good, better than I have had with any body a good while. He gone, I to my business again, and anon comes my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> and her <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2850/">son-in law</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">daughter</a>, and there we talked all the evening away, and then to supper; and after supper comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, and there we talked together, and then broke up, and so to bed. He tells me that our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/921/">Mr. Turner</a> has seen the proclamation against the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a>, and that therefore it is true what we heard last night. Yesterday and to-day I have been troubled with a hoarseness through cold that I could not almost speak.</p>

		<p>Up, and with my cold still upon me and hoarseness, but I was forced to rise and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning busy, and among other things <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> come to me, to whom of late I have been very strange, partly from my indifference how more than heretofore to get money, but most from my finding that he is become great with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, and so I dare not trust him as I used to do, for I will not be inward with him that is open to another. By and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a> to me about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> business, and then talking of news he tells me how yesterday <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> did publiquely talk of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France&#8217;s</a> dealing with all the Princes of Christendome. As to the States of Holland, he [the King of France] hath advised them, on good grounds, to refuse to treat with us at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/782/">the Hague</a>, because of having opportunity of spies, by reason of our interest in the House of Orange; and then, it being a town in one particular province, it would not be fit to have it, but in a town wherein the provinces have equal interest, as at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10871/">Mastricht</a>, and other places named. That he advises them to offer no terms, nor accept of any, without his privity and consent, according to agreement; and tells them, if not so, he hath in his power to be even with them, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">King of England</a> being come to offer him any terms he pleases; and that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1618/">Lord St. Albans</a> is now at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8787/">Paris</a>, Plenipotentiary, to make what peace he pleases; and so he can make it, and exclude them, the Dutch, if he sees fit. A copy of this letter of the King of France&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12951/">Spanish Ambassador</a> here gets, and comes and tells all to our King; which our King denies, and says the King of France only uses his power of saying anything. At the same time, the King of France writes to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6893/">the Emperor</a>, that he is resolved to do all things to express affection to the Emperor, having it now in his power to make what peace he pleases between the King of England and him, and the States of the United Provinces; and, therefore, that he would not have him to concern himself in a friendship with us; and assures him that, on that regard, he will not offer anything to his disturbance, in his interest in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/">Flanders</a>, or elsewhere. He writes, at the same time, to Spayne, to tell him that he wonders to hear of a league almost ended between the Crown of Spayne and England, by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a>, and all without his privity, while he was making a peace upon what terms he pleased with England: that he is a great lover of the Crown of Spayne, and would take the King and his affairs, during his minority, into his protection, nor would offer to set his foot in Flanders, or any where else, to disturb him; and, therefore, would not have him to trouble himself to make peace with any body; only he hath a desire to offer an exchange, which he thinks may be of moment to both sides: that is, that he [France] will enstate the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10146/">King of Spayne</a> in the kingdom of Portugall, and he and the Dutch will put him into possession of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10946/">Lisbon</a>; and, that being done, he [France] may have Flanders: and this, they say; do mightily take in Spayne, which is sensible of the fruitless expence Flanders, so far off, gives them; and how much better it would be for them to be master of Portugall; and the King of France offers, for security herein, that the King of England shall be bond for him, and that he will countersecure the King of England with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6848/">Amsterdam</a>; and, it seems, hath assured our King, that if he will make a league with him, he will make a peace exclusive to the Hollander. These things are almost romantique, but yet true, as Sir H. Cholmly tells me the King himself did relate it all yesterday; and it seems as if the King of France did think other princes fit for nothing but to make sport for him: but simple princes they are, that are forced to suffer this from him. So at noon with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">the Sun</a> in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3369/">Leadenhall Streete</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir R. Ford</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2214/">Commissioner Taylor</a> (whose feast it was) were, and we dined and had a very good dinner. Among other discourses Sir R. Ford did tell me that he do verily believe that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the city</a> will in few years be built again in all the greatest streets, and answered the objections I did give to it. Here we had the proclamation this day come out against the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a>, commanding him to come in to one of the Secretaries, or to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1156/">Lieutenant of the Tower</a>. A silly, vain man to bring himself to this: and there be many hard circumstances in the proclamation of the causes of this proceeding of the King&#8217;s, which speak great displeasure of the King&#8217;s, and crimes of his.</p>

<p>Then to discourse of the business of the day, that is, to see Commissioner Taylor&#8217;s accounts for his ship he built, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8412/">The Loyall London</a>, and it is pretty to see how dully this old fellow makes his demands, and yet plaguy wise sayings will come from the man sometimes, and also how Sir R. Ford and [Sir] W. Batten did with seeming reliance advise him what to do, and how to come prepared to answer objections to the Common Council.</p>

<p>Thence away to the office, where late busy, and then home to supper, mightily pleased with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> trill, and so to bed.</p>

<p>This night <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Mr. Carcasse</a> did come to me again to desire favour, and that I would mediate that he might be restored, but I did give him no kind answer at all, but was very angry, and I confess a good deal of it from my Lord Bruncker&#8217;s simplicity and passion.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> mighty quiet, and no words all day, which I wonder at, expecting that he would have fallen again upon the business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Carcasse</a>, and the more for that here happened that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10947/">Perkins</a>, who was the greatest witness of all against him, was brought in by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> to prove that he did really belong to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2462/">The Prince</a>, but being examined was found rather a fool than anything, as not being able to give any account when he come in nor when he come out of her, more than that he was taken by the Dutch in her, but did agree in earnest to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a> saying that she lay up all, the winter before at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1265/">Lambeth</a>. This I confess did make me begin to doubt the truth of his evidence, but not to doubt the faults of Carcasse, for he was condemned by, many other better evidences than his, besides the whole world&#8217;s report. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2745/">Mr. Goodgroome</a>, whose teaching of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> only by singing over and over again to her, and letting her sing with him, not by herself, to correct her faults, I do not like at all, but was angry at it; but have this content, that I do think she will come to sing pretty well, and to trill in time, which pleases me well. He dined with us, and then to the office, when we had a sorry meeting to little purpose, and then broke up, and I to my office, and busy late to good purpose, and so home to supper and to bed. This day a poor seaman, almost starved for want of food, lay in our yard a-dying. I sent him half-a-crown, and we ordered his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">ticket</a> to be paid.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">[Sir] W. Batten</a> to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> to our usual attendance, where I did fear my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> might move something in revenge that might trouble me, but he did not, but contrarily had the content to hear <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> fall foul on him in the Duke of York&#8217;s bed chamber for his directing people with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">tickets</a> and petitions to him, bidding him mind his Controller&#8217;s place and not his, for if he did he should be too hard for him, and made high words, which I was glad of. Having done our usual business with the Duke of York, I away; and meeting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. D. Gawden</a> in the presence-chamber, he and I to talk; and among other things he tells me, and I do find every where else, also, that our masters do begin not to like of their councils in fitting out no fleete, but only squadrons, and are finding out excuses for it; and, among others, he tells me a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/294/">Privy-Councillor</a> did tell him that it was said in Council that a fleete could not be set out this year, for want of victuals, which gives him and me a great alarme, but me especially for had it been so, I ought to have represented it; and therefore it puts me in policy presently to prepare myself to answer this objection, if ever it should come about, by drawing up a state of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualler&#8217;s</a> stores, which I will presently do. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there staid and talked, and then to Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s, where I dined with the ladies, he not at home, and very well used I am among them, so that I am heartily ashamed that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> hath not been there to see them; but she shall very shortly. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by water, and stepped into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell&#8217;s</a>, and there did baiser <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">my Betty</a>, &#8216;que aegrotat&#8217; a little. At home find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1536/">Mr. Holliard</a>, and made him eat a bit of victuals. Here I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10889/">Mr. Greeten</a>, who teaches <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> on the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/783/">flageolet</a>, and I think she will come to something on it. Mr. Holliard advises me to have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> come up to town, for he doubts else in the country he will never find ease, for, poor man, his grief is now grown so great upon him that he is never at ease, so I will have him up at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/315/">Easter</a>.</p>

<p>By and by by coach, set down Mr. Holliard near his house at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10948/">Hatton Garden</a> and myself to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, and sent my wife to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>. I staid not here, but to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7729/">Martin&#8217;s</a>, where he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">she</a> both within, and with them <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8607/">the little widow</a> that was once there with her when I was there, that dissembled so well to be grieved at hearing a tune that her, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9531/">late husband</a> liked, but there being so much company, I had no pleasure here, and so away to the Hall again, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10215/">Doll Lane</a> coming out, and &#8216;par contrat did hazer bargain para aller to the cabaret de vin&#8217;, called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10508/">the Rose</a>, and &#8216;ibi&#8217; I staid two hours, &#8216;sed&#8217; she did not &#8216;venir&#8217;, &#8216;lequel&#8217; troubled me, and so away by coach and took up my wife, and away home, and so to Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, where I am told that it is intended by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Mr. Carcasse</a> to pray me to be godfather with Lord Bruncker to-morrow to his child, which I suppose they tell me in mirth, but if he should ask me I know not whether I should refuse it or no.</p>

<p>Late at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> preparing a speech against to-morrow morning, before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, at my Lord Treasurer&#8217;s, and the truth is it run in my head all night.</p>

<p>So home to supper and to bed. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">The Duke of Buckingham</a> is concluded gone over sea, and, it is thought, to France.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, where we met with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> an hour before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> come, and had time to talk a little of our business. Then come much company, among others <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, who tells me that undoubtedly my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a> will go no more as Governor to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, and that he do put in fair for it, and believes he shall have it, and proposes how it may conduce to his account and mine in the business of money. Here we fell into talk with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/848/">Sir Stephen Fox</a>, and, among other things, of the Spanish manner of walking, when three together, and shewed me how, which was pretty, to prevent differences. By and by comes the King and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, and presently the officers of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5016/">the Ordnance</a> were called; my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/">Lord Berkeley</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8020/">Sir John Duncomb</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8021/">Mr. Chichly</a>; then we, my Lord Bruncker, [Sir] W. Batten, [Sir] W. Pen, and myself; where we find only the King and Duke of York, and my Lord Treasurer, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>; where I only did speak, laying down the state of our wants, which the King and Duke of York seemed very well pleased with, and we did get what we asked, 500,000<i>l.</i>, assigned upon the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11123/">eleven months&#8217; tax</a>: but that is not so much ready money, or what will raise 40,000<i>l.</i> per week, which we desired, and the business will want. Yet are we fain to come away answered, when, God knows, it will undo the King&#8217;s business to have matters of this moment put off in this manner. The King did prevent my offering anything by and by as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/">Treasurer for Tangier</a>, telling me that he had ordered us 30,000<i>l.</i> on the same tax; but that is not what we would have to bring our payments to come within a year. So we gone out, in went others; viz., one after another, Sir Stephen Fox for the army, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> for sick and wounded, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9422/">Mr. Ashburnham</a> for the household. Thence [Sir] W. Batten, [Sir] W. Pen, and I, back again; I mightily pleased with what I had said and done, and the success thereof. But, it being a fine clear day, I did, &#8216;en gayete de coeur&#8217;, propose going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5228/">Bow</a> for ayre sake, and dine there, which they embraced, and so [Sir] W. Batten and I (setting [Sir] W. Pen down at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3333/">Mark Lane</a> end) straight to Bow, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10949/">Queen&#8217;s Head</a>, and there bespoke our dinner, carrying meat with us from London; and anon comes [Sir] W. Pen with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">Lady Batten</a>, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2850/">Mr. Lowder</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10950/">his mother</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">wife</a>. While [Sir] W. Batten and I were alone, we had much friendly discourse, though I will never trust him far; but we do propose getting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10396/">&#8220;The Flying Greyhound,&#8221;</a> our privateer, to us and [Sir] W. Pen at the end of the year when we call her home, by begging her of the King, and I do not think we shall be denied her. They being come, we to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/">oysters</a> and so to talk, very pleasant I was all day, and anon to dinner, and I made very good company. Here till the evening, so as it was dark almost before we got <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> (back again in the same method, I think, we went), and spent the night talking at Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, only a little at my office, to look over the Victualler&#8217;s contract, and draw up some arguments for him to plead for his charges in transportation of goods beyond the ports which the letter of one article in his contract do lay upon him. This done I home to supper and to bed. Troubled a little at my fear that my Lord Bruncker should tell <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> of our neglecting the office this afternoon (which was intended) to look after our pleasures, but nothing will fall upon me alone about this.</p>

		<p>Up, and pleased at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">Tom&#8217;s</a> teaching of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">Barker</a> something to sing a 3rd part to a song, which will please mightily. So I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning, and at noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where I do hear that letters this day come to Court do tell us that we are likely not to agree, the Dutch demanding high terms, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> the like, in a most braving manner. The merchants do give themselves over for lost, no man knowing what to do, whether to sell or buy, not knowing whether peace or war to expect, and I am told that could that be now known a man might get 20,000<i>l.</i> in a week&#8217;s time by buying up of goods in case there should be war. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and dined well, and then with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, set her at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a> and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, where talked with the ladies a while, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/">Lady Carteret</a> talks nothing but sorrow and afflictions coming on us, and indeed I do fear the same. So away and met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/211/">Dr. Fuller</a>, Bishop of Limricke, and walked an hour with him in the Court talking of newes only, and he do think that matters will be bad with us. Then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there spent an hour or two walking up and down, thinking &#8216;para avoir&#8217; got out <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10215/">Doll Lane</a>, &#8216;sed je ne&#8217; could do it, having no opportunity &#8216;de hazer le, ainsi lost the tota&#8217; afternoon, and so away and called my wife and home, where a little at the office, and then home to my closet to enter my journalls, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This noon come little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9070/">Mis. Tooker</a>, who is grown a little woman; ego had opportunity &#8216;para baiser her &#8230;</p>

<p>This morning I was called up by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4960/">Sir John Winter</a>, poor man! come in his sedan from the other end of the town, before I was up, and merely about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> business, which is a worthy thing of him, and I believe him to be a worthy good man, and I will do him the right to tell <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> of it, who did speak well of him the other day. It was about helping the King in the business of bringing down his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a> to the sea-side, in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3901/">Forest of Deane</a>.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning; at noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then to the office again in the afternoon, and there all day very busy till night, and then, having done much business, home to supper, and so to bed. This afternoon come home <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, who has been down, but with little purpose, to pay the ships below at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8827/">Nore</a>. This evening, having done my letters, I did write out the heads of what I had prepared to speak to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> the other day at my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, which I do think convenient to keep by me for future use. The weather is now grown warm again, after much cold; and it is observable that within these eight days I did see smoke remaining, coming out of some cellars, from the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">great fire</a>, now above six months since. There was this day at the office (as he is most days) <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, against whom I did manifestly plead, and heartily too, God forgive me! But the reason is because I do find that he do now wholly rely almost upon my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, though I confess I have no greater ground of my leaving him than the confidence which I perceive he hath got in my Lord Bruncker, whose seeming favours only do obtain of him as much compensation as, I believe (for he do know well the way of using his bounties), as mine more real. Besides, my Lord and I being become antagonistic, I do not think it safe for me to trust myself in the hands of one whom I know to be a knave, and using all means to become gracious there.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up betime with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and by coach with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1204/">Sir Thomas Allen</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, there my wife and I the first time that ever we went to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/">Lady Jemimah&#8217;s</a> chamber at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10951/">Sir Edward Carteret&#8217;s</a> lodgings. I confess I have been much to blame and much ashamed of our not visiting her sooner, but better now than never. Here we took her before she was up, which I was sorry for, so only saw her, and away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1042/">chapel</a>, leaving further visit till after sermon. I put my wife into the pew below, but it was pretty to see, myself being but in a plain <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5633/">band</a>, and every way else ordinary, how the verger took me for her man, I think, and I was fain to tell him she was a kinswoman of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, he saying that none under knights-baronets&#8217; ladies are to go into that pew. So she being there, I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York&#8217;s</a> lodging, where in his dressing-chamber he talking of his journey to-morrow or next day to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, to prepare some fortifications there; so that we are wholly upon the defensive part this year, only we have some expectations that we may by our squadrons annoy them in their trade by the North of Scotland and to the Westward. Here Sir W. Pen did show the Duke of York a letter of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10657/">Hogg&#8217;s</a> about a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prize</a> he drove in within the Sound at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5849/">Plymouth</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10952/">the Vice-Admiral</a> claims her. Sir W. Pen would have me speak to the latter, which I did, and I think without any offence, but afterwards I was sorry for it, and Sir W. Pen did plainly say that he had no mind to speak to the Duke of York about it, so that he put me upon it, but it shall be, the last time that I will do such another thing, though I think no manner of hurt done by it to me at all.</p>

<p>That done I to walk in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Parke</a>, where to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7305/">Queene&#8217;s Chapel</a>, and there heard a fryer preach with his cord about his middle, in Portuguese, something I could understand, showing that God did respect the meek and humble, as well as the high and rich. He was full of action, but very decent and good, I thought, and his manner of delivery very good. Then I went back to White Hall, and there up to the closet, and spoke with several people till sermon was ended, which was preached by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10953/">Bishop of Hereford</a>, an old good man, that they say made an excellent sermon. He was by birth a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/306/">Catholique</a>, and a great gallant, having 1500<i>l.</i> per annum, patrimony, and is a Knight Barronet; was turned from his persuasion by the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10461/">Archbishop Laud</a>. He and the Bishop of Exeter, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10954/">Dr. Ward</a>, are the two Bishops that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> do say he cannot have bad sermons from. Here I met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, who tells me, that undoubtedly my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a> do go no more to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, and that he do believe he do stand in a likely way to go Governor; though he says, and showed me, a young silly Lord, one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10955/">Lord Allington</a>, who hath offered a great sum of money to go, and will put hard for it, he having <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10956/">a fine lady</a>, and a great man would be glad to have him out of the way.</p>

<p>After Chapel I down and took out my wife from the pew, where she was talking with a lady whom I knew not till I was gone. It was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10957/">Mrs. Ashfield</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1768/">Brampton</a>, who had with much civility been, it seems, at our house to see her. I am sorry I did not show her any more respect.</p>

<p>With my wife to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a>, where we dined and mightily made of, and most extraordinary people they are to continue friendship with for goodness, virtue, and nobleness and interest. After dinner he and I alone awhile and did joy ourselves in my Lord Sandwich&#8217;s being out of the way all this time. He concurs that we are in a way of ruin by thus being forced to keep only small squadrons out, but do tell me that it was not choice, but only force, that we could not keep out the whole fleete. He tells me that the King is very kind to my Lord Sandwich, and did himself observe to him (Sir G. Carteret), how those very people, meaning <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">the Prince</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, are punished in the same kind as they did seek to abuse my Lord Sandwich. Thence away, and got a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/575/">hackney coach</a> and carried my wife <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there only drank, and myself back again to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, where the King, Duke of York, and Sir G. Carteret and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> were and none else, so I staid not, but to White Hall, and there meeting nobody I would speak with, walked into the Park and took two or three turns all alone, and then took coach and home, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, who I was glad to see, but durst [not] shew so, my wife being displeased with her, and indeed I fear she is grown a very gossip. I to my chamber, and there fitted my arguments which I had promised <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gawden</a> in his behalf in some pretences to allowance of the King, and then to supper, and so to my chamber a little again, and then to bed. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2558/">Duke of Buckingham</a> not heard of yet.</p>

		<p>Up betimes, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> to write fair my paper for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">D. Gawden</a> against anon, and then to other business, where all the morning. D. Gawden by and by comes, and I did read over and give him the paper, which I think I have much obliged him in. A little before noon comes my old good friend, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10965/">Mr. Richard Cumberland</a>,<sup id="fnr1-1667-03-18"><a href="#fn1-1667-03-18">1</a></sup> to see me, being newly come to town, whom I have not seen almost, if not quite, these seven years. In his plain country-parson&#8217;s dress. I could not spend much time with him, but prayed him come with his brother, who was with him, to dine with me to-day; which he did do and I had a great deal of his good company; and a most excellent person he is as any I know, and one that I am sorry should be lost and buried in a little country town, and would be glad to remove him thence; and the truth is, if he would accept of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">my sister&#8217;s</a> fortune, I should give 100<i>l.</i> more with him than to a man able to settle her four times as much as, I fear, he is able to do; and I will think of it, and a way how to move it, he having in discourse said he was not against marrying, nor yet engaged. I shewed him my closet, and did give him some very good musique, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8104/">Mr. Caesar</a> being here upon his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/540/">lute</a>. They gone I to the office, where all the afternoon very busy, and among other things comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10966/">Captain Jenifer</a> to me, a great servant of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, who tells me that he do hear for certain, though I do not yet believe it, that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> is to be Secretary of State, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> Lord Treasurer. I only wish that the latter were as fit for the latter office as the former is for the former, and more fit than my Lord Arlington. Anon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> come and talked with me in the garden, and tells me that for certain the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6590/">Duke of Richmond</a> is to marry <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a>, he having this day brought in an account of his estate and debts to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> on that account. At night <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to supper and so to bed. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">My father&#8217;s</a> letter this day do tell me of his own continued illness, and that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> grows so much worse, that he fears she cannot long continue, which troubles me very much. This day, Mr. Caesar told me a pretty experiment of his, of angling with a minikin, a gut-string <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13821/">varnished</a> over, which keeps it from swelling, and is beyond any hair for strength and smallness. The secret I like mightily.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we sat all the morning. At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> very pleasantly with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and after dinner with a great deal of pleasure had her sing, which she begins to do with some pleasure to me, more than I expected. Then to the office again, where all the afternoon close, and at night home to supper and to bed. It comes in my mind this night to set down how a house was the other day in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2191/">Bishopsgate Street</a> blowed up with powder; a house that was untenanted, and between a flax shop and a &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-, both bad for fire; but, thanks be to God, it did no more hurt; and all do conclude it a plot. I would also remember to my shame how I was pleased yesterday, to find the righteous maid of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/">Magister Griffin</a> sweeping of &#8216;nostra&#8217; office, &#8216;elle con the Roman nariz and bonne&#8217; body which I did heretofore like, and do still refresh me to think &#8216;que elle&#8217; is come to us, that I may &#8216;voir her aliquando&#8217;. This afternoon I am told again that the town do talk of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington&#8217;s</a> being to be Lord Treasurer, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> to be Secretary of State; and that for certain the match is concluded between the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6590/">Duke of Richmond</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a>, which I am well enough pleased with; and it is pretty to consider how his quality will allay people&#8217;s talk; whereas, had a meaner person married her, he would for certain have been reckoned a cuckold at first-dash.</p>

		<p>Up pretty betimes, and to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>, and there drank at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">Michell&#8217;s</a>, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">his wife</a> is not there, but gone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6513/">her mother&#8217;s</a>, who is ill, and so hath staid there since Sunday. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> and drank at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, and &#8216;baiserais the petite misse&#8217;; and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin&#8217;s</a> &#8230; I sent for some burnt <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>, and drank and then away, not pleased with my folly, and so to the Hall again, and there staid a little, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by water again, where, after speaking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">[Sir] J. Minnes</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">our church</a> to the vestry, to be assessed by the late <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10745/">Poll Bill</a>, where I am rated as an Esquire, and for my office, all will come to about 50<i>l.</i>. But not more than I expected, nor so much by a great deal as I ought to be, for all my offices. So shall be glad to escape so. Thence by water again to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there up into the house, and do hear that newes is come now that the enemy do incline again to a peace, but could hear no particulars, so do not believe it. I had a great mind to have spoke with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, about a business proper enough for me, about the French prize <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10489/">man-of-war</a>, how he would have her altered, only out of a desire to show myself mindful of business, but my linen was so dirty and my clothes mean, that I neither thought it fit to do that, nor go to other persons at the Court, with whom I had business, which did vex me, and I must remedy [it]. Here I hear that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6590/">Duke of Richmond</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a> were betrothed last night. Thence to Westminster Hall again, and there saw Betty Michell, and bought a pair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a> of her, she being fain to keep shop there, her mother being sick, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6514/">her father</a> gathering of the tax. I &#8216;aimais her de toute my corazon&#8217;. Thence, my mind wandering all this day upon &#8216;mauvaises amours&#8217; which I be merry for. So home by water again, where I find my wife gone abroad, so I to Sir W. Batten to dinner, and had a good dinner of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3162/">ling</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1332/">herring</a> pie, very good meat, best of the kind that ever I had. Having dined, I by coach to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">Temple</a>, and there did buy a little book or two, and it is strange how &#8220;<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10441/">Rycaut&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10442/">Discourse of Turky</a>,&#8221; which before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a> I was asked but 8<i>s.</i> for, there being all but twenty-two or thereabouts burned, I did now offer 20<i>s.</i>, and he demands 50<i>s.</i>, and I think I shall give it him, though it be only as a monument of the fire. So to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, where I find my wife, and so took her to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>, and left her there, and I to White Hall, and thence to Westminster, only out of idleness, and to get some little pleasure to my &#8216;mauvais flammes&#8217;, but sped not, so back and took up my wife; and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10289/">Polichinelli</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Crosse</a>, which is prettier and prettier, and so full of variety that it is extraordinary good entertainment. Thence by coach home, that is, my wife home, and I to the Exchange, and there met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1637/">Fenn</a>, who tells me they have yet no orders out of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/290/">Exchequer</a> for money upon the Acts, which is a thing not to be borne by any Prince of understanding or care, for no money can be got advanced upon the Acts only from the weight of orders in form out of the Exchequer so long time after the passing of the Acts. So home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> a little, where I met with a sad letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, who tells me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> is declared by the doctors to be past recovery, and that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> is also very ill every hour: so that I fear we shall see a sudden change there. God fit them and us for it! So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a>, where my wife was, and supped with a little, but yet little mirth, and a bad, nasty supper, which makes me not love the family, they do all things so meanly, to make a little bad show upon their backs. Thence home and to bed, very much troubled about my father&#8217;s and my mother&#8217;s illness.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where sat all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and had some melancholy discourse with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother&#8217;s</a> being so ill and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a>, and after dinner to cheer myself, I having the opportunity of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York&#8217;s</a> being out of town, I alone out and to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2935/">Duke of York&#8217;s play-house</a>, where unexpectedly I come to see only the young men and women of the house act; they having liberty to act for their own profit on Wednesdays and Fridays this <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/469/">Lent</a>: and the play they did yesterday, being Wednesday, was so well-taken, that they thought fit to venture it publickly to-day; a play of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10967/">Lord Falkland&#8217;s</a> called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10968/">&#8220;The Wedding Night,&#8221;</a> a kind of a tragedy, and some things very good in it, but the whole together, I thought, not so. I confess I was well enough pleased with my seeing it: and the people did do better, without the great actors, than I did expect, but yet far short of what they do when they are there, which I was glad to find the difference of. Thence to rights home, and there to the office to my business hard, being sorry to have made this scape without my wife, but I have a good salvo to my oath in doing it. By and by, in the evening, comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2575/">Mingo</a> to me to pray me to come to his master and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir Richard Ford</a>, who have very ill news to tell me. I knew what it was, it was about our trial for a good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prize</a> to-day, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10769/">&#8220;The Phoenix,&#8221;</a> a worth two or 3000<i>l.</i>. I went to them, where they told me with much trouble how they had sped, being cast and sentenced to make great reparation for what we had embezzled, and they did it so well that I was much troubled at it, when by and by Sir W. Batten asked me whether I was mortified enough, and told me we had got the day, which was mighty welcome news to me and us all. But it is pretty to see what money will do. Yesterday, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1229/">Walker</a> was mighty cold on our behalf, till Sir W. Batten promised him, if we sped in this business of the goods, a coach; and if at the next trial we sped for the ship, we would give him a pair of horses. And he hath strove for us today like a prince, though the Swedes&#8217; Agent was there with all the vehemence he could to save the goods, but yet we carried it against him. This put me in mighty good heart, and then we go to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, who is come back to-night from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/643/">Chatham</a>, and did put him into the same condition, and then comforted him. So back to my office, and wrote an affectionate and sad letter to my father about his and my mother&#8217;s illness, and so home to supper and to bed late.</p>

		<p>Up and by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke</a> about business for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> about money, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/848/">Sir Stephen Fox</a> to give him account of a little service I have done him about money coming to him from our office, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Lovett&#8217;s</a> and saw a few baubling things of their doing which are very pretty, but the quality of the people, living only by shifts, do not please me, that it makes me I do no more care for them, nor shall have more acquaintance with them after I have got my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne&#8217;s</a> picture home. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> at Chapel, and I would not stay, but to Westminster to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6514/">Howlett&#8217;s</a>, and there, he being not well, I sent for a quart of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">claret</a> and burnt it and drank, and had a &#8216;basado&#8217; or three or four of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">Sarah</a>, whom &#8216;je trouve ici&#8217;, and so by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8584/">Sir Robt. Viner&#8217;s</a> about my accounts with him, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where I hear for certain that we are going on with our treaty of peace, and that we are to treat at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10869/">Bredah</a>. But this our condescension people do think will undo us, and I do much fear it. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> having dressed herself in a silly dress of a blue petticoat uppermost, and a white satin waistcoat and whitehood, though I think she did it because her gown is gone to the tailor&#8217;s, did, together with my being hungry, which always makes me peevish, make me angry, but when my belly was full were friends again, and dined and then by water down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a> and thence walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>, all the way reading <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/332/">Playford&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10969/">&#8220;Introduction to Musique,&#8221;</a> wherein are some things very pretty. At Woolwich I did much business, taking an account of the state of the ships there under hand, thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1814/">Blackwall</a>, and did the like for two ships we have repairing there, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> and did the like there, and so home. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10970/">Captain Perriman</a> with me from Deptford, telling me many particulars how the King&#8217;s business is ill ordered, and indeed so they are, God knows! So home and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where did business, and so home to my chamber, and then to supper and to bed. Landing at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a> to-night I met on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/">Tower Hill</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> and spent half an hour walking in the dusk of the evening with him, talking of the sorrowful condition we are in, that we must be ruined if the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> do not come and chastize us, that we are resolved to make a peace whatever it cost, that the King is disobliging the Parliament in this interval all that may be, yet his money is gone and he must have more, and they likely not to give it, without a great deal of do. God knows what the issue of it will be. But the considering that the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, instead of being at sea as Admirall, is now going from port to port, as he is at this day at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, and was the other day with the King at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/">Sheernesse</a>, and hath ordered at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a> how fortifications shall be made to oppose the enemy, in case of invasion, [which] is to us a sad consideration, and as shameful to the nation, especially after so many proud vaunts as we have made against the Dutch, and all from the folly of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, who made nothing of beating them, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Sir John Lawson</a> he always declared that we never did fail to beat them with lesser numbers than theirs, which did so prevail with the King as to throw us into this war.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). With <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, who is mighty cheerful, which makes me think and by some discourse that there is expectation of a peace, but I did not ask [him]. Here was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> also: and they did talk of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, whose <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10971/">father</a>, it seems, did give <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9471/">Mr. Ashburnham</a> and the present <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2845/">Lord Digby</a> 1200<i>l.</i> to be made an Irish lord, and swore the same day that he had not 12<i>d.</i> left to pay for his dinner: they make great mirth at this, my Lord Bruncker having lately given great matter of offence both to them and us all, that we are at present mightily displeased with him. By and by to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, where we all met, and there was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> also; and all our discourse was about fortifying of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8835/">Medway</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, which is to be entrenched quite round, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>: and here they advised with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10972/">Sir Godfry Lloyd</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10973/">Sir Bernard de Gum</a>, the two great engineers, and had the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6261/">plates</a> drawn before them; and indeed all their care they now take is to fortify themselves, and are not ashamed of it: for when by and by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> come in with letters, and seeing the King and Duke of York give us and the officers of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5016/">Ordnance</a> directions in this matter, he did move that we might do it as privately as we could, that it might not come into the Dutch Gazette presently, as the King&#8217;s and Duke of York&#8217;s going down the other day to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8834/">Sheerenesse</a> was, the week after, in the Harlem Gazette. The King and Duke of York both laughed at it, and made no matter, but said, &#8220;Let us be safe, and let them talk, for there is nothing will trouble them more, nor will prevent their coming more, than to hear that we are fortifying ourselves.&#8221; And the Duke of York said further, &#8220;What said <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10974/">Marshal Turenne</a>, when some in vanity said that the enemies were afraid, for they entrenched themselves? `Well,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I would they were not afraid, for then they would not entrench themselves, and so we could deal with them the better.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Away thence, and met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a>, who tells me that he do believe the government of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> is bought by my Lord Allington for a sum of money to my Lord Arlington, and something to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, who (he did tell me particularly how) is as very a false villain as ever was born, having received money of him here upon promise and confidence of his return, forcing him to pay it by advance here, and promising to ask no more there, when at the same time he was treating with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10955/">Lord Allington</a> to sell his command to him, and yet told Sir H. Cholmly nothing of it, but when Sir H. Cholmly told him what he had heard, he confessed that my Lord Allington had spoken to him of it, but that he was a vain man to look after it, for he was nothing fit for it, and then goes presently to my Lord Allington and drives on the bargain, yet tells Lord Allington what he himself had said of him, as [though] Sir H. Cholmly had said them. I am glad I am informed hereof, and shall know him for a Lord, &amp;c. Sir H. Cholmly tells me further that he is confident there will be a peace, and that a great man did tell him that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Lord Albemarle</a> did tell him the other day at White Hall as a secret that we should have a peace if any thing the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> can ask and our King can give will gain it, which he is it seems mad at.</p>

<p>Thence back with Sir W. Batten and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> home, and heard a piece of sermon, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> come, very fine, and dined with us, and after dinner with me by water to White Hall, and there he and I did walk round <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Park</a>, I giving him my thoughts about the difficulty of getting employment for him this year, but advised him how to employ himself, and I would do what I could. So he and I parted, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Martin&#8217;s</a>, where I find her within, and &#8216;su hermano&#8217; and &#8216;la veuve&#8217; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8607/">Burroughs</a>. Here I did &#8216;demeurer toda&#8217; the afternoon &#8230; By and by come up the mistress of the house, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10975/">Crags</a>, a pleasant jolly woman. I staid all but a little, and away home by water through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">bridge</a>, a brave evening, and so home to read, and anon to supper, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> with us, and then to read myself to sleep again, and then to bed, and mightily troubled the most of the night with fears of fire, which I cannot get out of my head to this day since the last <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">great fire</a>. I did this night give the waterman who uses to carry me 10<i>s.</i> at his request, for the painting of his new boat, on which shall be my arms.</p>

		<p>(Ladyday.) Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/103/">Exeter House</a> to our lawyers to have consulted about our trial to-morrow, but missed them, so parted, and [Sir] W. Pen and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a> about a little business of [Sir] W. Pen&#8217;s, where we went over Mr. Povy&#8217;s house, which lies in the same good condition as ever, which is most extraordinary fine, and he was now at work with a cabinet-maker, making of a new inlaid table. Having seen his house, we away, having in our way thither called at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1488/">Mr. Lilly&#8217;s</a>, who was working; and indeed his pictures are without doubt much beyond <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Mr. Hales&#8217;s</a>, I think I may say I am convinced: but a mighty proud man he is, and full of state. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and by and by to dinner, a poor dinner, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I, at Sir W. Pen&#8217;s, and then he and I before to Exeter House, where I do not stay, but to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/475/">King&#8217;s playhouse</a>; and by and by comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2850/">Mr. Lowther</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">his wife</a> and mine, and into a box, forsooth, neither of them being dressed, which I was almost ashamed of. Sir W. Pen and I in the pit, and here saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10905/">&#8220;The Mayden Queene&#8221;</a> again; which indeed the more I see the more I like, and is an excellent play, and so done by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5037/">Nell</a>, her merry part, as cannot be better done in nature, I think. Thence home, and there I find letters from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, which tell me that yesterday when he wrote <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> did rattle in the throat so as they did expect every moment her death, which though I have a good while expected did much surprise me, yet was obliged to sup at Sir W. Pen&#8217;s and my wife, and there counterfeited some little mirth, but my heart was sad, and so home after supper and to bed, and much troubled in my sleep of my being crying by my mother&#8217;s bedside, laying my head over hers and crying, she almost dead and dying, and so waked, but what is strange, methought she had hair over her face, and not the same kind of face as my mother really hath, but yet did not consider that, but did weep over her as my mother, whose soul God have mercy of.</p>

		<p>Up with a sad heart in reference to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a>, of whose death I undoubtedly expect to hear the next post, if not of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father&#8217;s</a> also, who by his pain as well as his grief for her is very ill, but on my own behalf I have cause to be joyful this day, it being my usual <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6128/">feast day</a>, for my being cut of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/346/">stone</a> this day nine years, and through God&#8217;s blessing am at this day and have long been in as good condition of health as ever I was in my life or any man in England is, God make me thankful for it! But the condition I am in, in reference to my mother, makes it unfit for me to keep my usual feast. Unless it shall please God to send her well (which I despair wholly of), and then I will make amends for it by observing another day in its room. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and at the office all the morning, where I had an opportunity to speak to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8721/">Sir John Harman</a> about my desire to have my brother <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> go again with him to sea as he did the last year, which he do seem not only contented but pleased with, which I was glad of. So at noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, who dined with us, but I had not any time to talk with him, my head being busy, and before I had dined was called away by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, and both of us in his coach (which I observe his coachman do always go now from hence towards <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1117/">Tower Street</a>, and it is the best way) to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/103/">Exeter House</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10990/">the judge</a> was sitting, and after several little causes comes on ours, and while the several depositions and papers were at large reading (which they call the preparatory), and being cold by being forced to sit with my hat off close to a window in the Hall, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> and I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10776/">Castle Tavern</a> hard by and got a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/374/">lobster</a>, and he and I staid and eat it, and drank good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>; I only burnt wine, as my whole custom of late hath been, as an evasion, God knows, for my drinking of wine (but it is an evasion which will not serve me now hot weather is coming, that I cannot pretend, as indeed I really have done, that I drank it for cold), but I will leave it off, and it is but seldom, as when I am in women&#8217;s company, that I must call for wine, for I must be forced to drink to them. Having done here then we back again to the Court, and there heard our cause pleaded; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10991/">Sir [Edward] Turner</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1229/">Sir W. Walker</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7163/">Sir Ellis Layton</a> being our counsel against only <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6169/">Sir Robert Wiseman</a> on the other. The second of our three counsel was the best, and indeed did speak admirably, and is a very shrewd man. Nevertheless, as good as he did make our case, and the rest, yet when Wiseman come to argue (nay, and though he did begin so sillily that we laughed in scorn in our sleeves at him), yet he did so state the case, that the judge did not think fit to decide the cause to-night, but took to to-morrow, and did stagger us in our hopes, so as to make us despair of the success. I am mightily pleased with the judge, who seems a very rational, learned, and uncorrupt man, and much good reading and reason there is heard in hearing of this law argued, so that the thing pleased me, though our success doth shake me. Thence Sir W. Pen and I home and to write letters, among others a sad one to my father upon fear of my mother&#8217;s death, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and in the coach did begin our discourse again about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a>, and he promises me to move it this very day. He and I met my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> by appointment, there to discourse a little business, all being likely to go to rack for lack of money still. Thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York&#8217;s</a> lodgings, and did our usual business, and Sir W. Pen telling me that he had this morning spoke of Balty to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, and that the thing was done, I did take notice of it also to [Sir] W. Coventry, who told me that he had both the thing and the person in his head before to have done it, which is a double pleasure to me. Our business with the Duke being done, [Sir] W. Pen and I towards <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a>, and in our way met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/106/">Sir G. Downing</a> going to chapel, but we stopped, and he would go with us back to the Exchequer and showed us in his office his chests full and ground and shelves full of money, and says that there is 50,000<i>l.</i> at this day in his office of people&#8217;s money, who may demand it this day, and might have had it away several weeks ago upon the late Act, but do rather choose to have it continue there than to put it into the Banker&#8217;s hands, and I must confess it is more than I should have believed had I not seen it, and more than ever I could have expected would have arisen for this new Act in so short a time, and if it do so now already what would it do if the money was collected upon the Act and returned into the Exchequer so timely as it ought to be. But it comes into my mind here to observe what I have heard from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7290/">Sir John Bankes</a>, though I cannot fully conceive the reason of it, that it will be impossible to make the Exchequer ever a true bank to all intents, unless the Exchequer stood nearer <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a>, where merchants might with ease, while they are going about their business, at all hours, and without trouble or loss of time, have their satisfaction, which they cannot have now without much trouble, and loss of half a day, and no certainty of having the offices open. By this he means a bank for common practise and use of merchants, and therein I do agree with him. Being parted from Sir W. Pen and [Sir] G. Downing, I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> and there met Balty, whom I had sent for, and there did break the business of my getting him the place of going again as Muster-Master with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8721/">Harman</a> this voyage to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10697/">West Indys</a>, which indeed I do owe to Sir W. Pen. He is mighty glad of it, and earnest to fit himself for it, but I do find, poor man, that he is troubled how to dispose of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">his wife</a>, and apparently it is out of fear of her, and his honour, and I believe he hath received some cause of this his jealousy and care, and I do pity him in it, and will endeavour to find out some way to do, it for him. Having put him in a way of preparing himself for the voyage, I did go to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1050/">the Swan</a>, and there sent for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6230/">Jervas</a>, my old <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/517/">periwig</a> maker, and he did bring me a periwig, but it was full of nits, so as I was troubled to see it (it being his old fault), and did send him to make it clean, and in the mean time, having staid for him a good while, did go away by water to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10776/">Castle Taverne</a>, by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/103/">Exeter House</a>, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, [Sir] W. Pen, and several others, among the rest <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7163/">Sir Ellis Layton</a>, who do apply himself to discourse with me, and I think by his discourse, out of his opinion of my interest in Sir W. Coventry, the man I find a wonderful witty, ready man for sudden answers and little tales, and sayings very extraordinary witty, but in the bottom I doubt he is not so. Yet he pretends to have studied men, and the truth is in several that I do know he did give me a very inward account of them. But above all things he did give me a full account, upon my demand, of this judge of the Admiralty, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10990/">Judge Jenkins</a>; who, he says, is a man never practised in this Court, but taken merely for his merit and ability&#8217;s sake from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10531/">Trinity Hall</a>, where he had always lived; only by accident the business of the want of a Judge being proposed to the present <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2519/">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> that now is, he did think of this man and sent for him up: and here he is, against the &#8216;gre&#8217; and content of the old Doctors, made judge, but is a very excellent man both for judgment and temper, yet majesty enough, and by all men&#8217;s report, not to be corrupted. After dinner to the Court, where Sir Ellis Layton did make a very silly motion in our behalf, but did neither hurt nor good. After him <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1229/">Walker</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6169/">Wiseman</a>; and then the judge did pronounce his sentence; for some part of the goods and ship, and the freight of the whole, to be free, and returned and paid by us; and the remaining, which was the greater part, to be ours. The loss of so much troubles us, but we have got a pretty good part, thanks be to God! So we are not displeased nor yet have cause to triumph, as we did once expect. Having seen the end of this, I being desirous to be at home to see the issue of any country letters about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a>, which I expect shall give me tidings of her death, I directly <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and there to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where I find no letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> or brother, but by and by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">the boy</a> tells me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">his mistress</a> sends me word that she hath opened my letter, and that she is loth to send me any more news. So I home, and there up to my wife in our chamber, and there received from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> the newes of my mother&#8217;s dying on Monday, about five or six o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and that the last time she spoke of her children was on Friday last, and her last words were, &#8220;God bless my poor Sam!&#8221; The reading hereof did set me a-weeping heartily, and so weeping to myself awhile, and my wife also to herself, I then spoke to my wife respecting myself, and indeed, having some thoughts how much better both for her and us it is than it might have been had she outlived my father and me or my happy present condition in the world, she being helpless, I was the sooner at ease in my mind, and then found it necessary to go abroad with my wife to look after the providing mourning to send into the country, some to-morrow, and more against Sunday, for my family, being resolved to put myself and wife, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">Barker</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> and Tom, in mourning, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10106/">two</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">under-mayds</a>, to give them hoods and scarfs and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a>. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9587/">my tailor&#8217;s</a>, and up and down, and then home and to my office a little, and then to supper and to bed, my heart sad and afflicted, though my judgment at ease.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9587/">My tailor</a> come to me betimes this morning, and having given him directions, I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and there all the morning. At noon dined well. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a>, who is mighty thoughtful how to dispose of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">his wife</a>, and would fain have me provide a place for her, which the thoughts of what I should do with her if he should miscarry at sea makes me avoid the offering him that she should be at my house. I find he is plainly jealous of her being in any place where she may have ill company, and I do pity him for it, and would be glad to help him, and will if I can. Having dined, I down by water with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">[Sir] R. Ford</a> to our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prize</a>, part of whose goods were condemned yesterday &#8212; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10992/">&#8220;The Lindeboome&#8221;</a> &#8212; and there we did drink some of her <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>, very good. But it did  grate my heart to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11042/">the poor master</a> come on board, and look about into every corner, and find fault that she was not so clean as she used to be, though methought she was very clean; and to see his new masters come in, that had nothing to do with her, did trouble me to see him. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1814/">Blackwall</a> and there to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1534/">Mr. Johnson&#8217;s</a>, to see how some works upon some of our repaired ships go on, and at his house eat and drank and mighty extraordinary merry (too merry for me whose <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">mother</a> died so lately, but they know it not, so cannot reproach me therein, though I reproach myself), and in going <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> had many good stories of Sir W. Batten and one of Sir W. Pen, the most tedious and silly and troublesome (he forcing us to hear him) that ever I heard in my life. So to the office awhile, troubled with Sir W. Pen&#8217;s impertinences, he being half foxed at Johnson&#8217;s, and so to bed.</p>

		<p>Lay long talking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a>, whom I do wish very well to, and would be glad to advise him, for he is very sober and willing to take all pains. Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, who I find has had some words with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> about the employing of a cooper about our prize <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wines</a>, [Sir] W. Batten standing and indeed imposing upon us <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2407/">Mr. Morrice</a>, which I like not, nor do [Sir] W. Pen, and I confess the very thoughts of what our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">goods</a> will come to when we have them do discourage me in going any further in the adventure. Then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> till noon, doing business, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a>, and thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">Sun Taverne</a> and dined with [Sir] W. Batten, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">[Sir] R. Ford</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10767/">the Swede&#8217;s Agent</a> to discourse of a composition about our prizes that are condemned, but did do little, he standing upon high terms and we doing the like. I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and there find Balty and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">his wife</a> got thither both by my wife for me to give them good advice, for her to be with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1067/">his father</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/">mother</a> all this time of absence, for saving of money, and did plainly and like a friend tell them my mind of the necessity of saving money, and that if I did not find they did endeavour it, I should not think fit to trouble myself for them, but I see she is utterly against being with his father and mother, and he is fond of her, and I perceive the differences between the old people and them are too great to be presently forgot, and so he do propose that it will be cheaper for him to put her to board at a place he is offered at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11000/">Lee</a>, and I, seeing that I am not like to be troubled with the finding a place, and having given him so much good advice, do leave them to stand and fall as they please, having discharged myself as a friend, and not likely to be accountable for her nor be troubled with her, if he should miscarry I mean, as to her lodging, and so broke up. Then he and I to make a visit to [Sir] W. Pen, who hath thought fit to show kindness to Balty in this business, indeed though he be a false rogue, but it was he knew a thing easy to do. Thence together to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/564/">shoemaker&#8217;s</a>, cutler&#8217;s, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9587/">tailor&#8217;s</a>, and up and down about my mourning, and in my way do observe the great streets in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the city</a> are marked out with piles drove into the ground; and if ever it be built in that form with so fair streets, it will be a noble sight. So to the Council chamber, but staid not there, but to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2325/">periwigg</a>-maker&#8217;s of his acquaintance, and there bought two periwiggs, mighty fine; indeed, too fine, I thought, for me; but he persuaded me, and I did buy them for 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> the two. Then to the Exchange and bought <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a>, and so to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1180/">Bull-Head Taverne</a>, whither he brought my French gun; and one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11001/">Truelocke</a>, the famous gunsmith, that is a mighty ingenious man, and he did take my gun in pieces, and made me understand the secrets thereof and upon the whole I do find it a very good piece of work, and truly wrought; but for certain not a thing to be used much with safety: and he do find that this very gun was never yet shot off: I was mighty satisfied with it and him, and the sight of so much curiosity of this kind. Here he brought also a haberdasher at my desire, and I bought a hat of him, and so away and called away my wife from his house, and so home and to read, and then to supper and to bed, my head full in behalf of Balty, who tells me strange stories of his mother. Among others, how she, in his absence in Ireland, did pawne all the things that he had got in his service under <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/796/">Oliver</a>, and run of her own accord, without her husband&#8217;s leave, into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8790/">Flanders</a>, and that his purse, and 4<i>s.</i> a week which his father receives of the French church, is all the subsistence his father and mother have, and that about 20<i>l.</i> a year maintains them; which, if it please God, I will find one way or other to provide for them, to remove that scandal away.</p>

		<p>Up, and the French <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/517/">periwigg</a> maker of whom I bought two yesterday comes with them, and I am very well pleased with them. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and thence with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> knowledge and leave did by coach go see the silly play of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11002/">Lady Newcastle&#8217;s</a>, called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11047/">&#8220;The Humourous Lovers;&#8221;</a> the most silly thing that ever come upon a stage. I was sick to see it, but yet would not but have seen it, that I might the better understand her. Here I spied <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10779/">Betty</a>, of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/475/">King&#8217;s house</a>, and sent Knipp <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/391/">oranges</a>, but, having little money about me, did not offer to carry them abroad, which otherwise I had, I fear, been tempted to. So with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> home (he being at the play also), a most summer evening, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, where, among other things, a most extraordinary letter to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a> touching the want of money and the sad state of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> service thereby, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9587/">my tailor&#8217;s</a> boy brings my mourning clothes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> hers and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">Barker&#8217;s</a>, but they go not to church this morning. I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, and with my mourning, very handsome, and new <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2325/">periwigg</a>, make a great shew. After church home to dinner, and there come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Michell</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">her husband</a>. I do and shall love her, but, poor wretch, she is now almost ready to lie down. After dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> (who dined also with us) and I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> in his coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, but did nothing, but by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/277/">Strand Bridge</a> and thence walked to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of York</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13278/">the Caball</a>, and much company without; and a fine day. Anon come out from the Caball my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/886/">Lord Hollis</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7404/">Mr. H. Coventry</a>, who, it is conceived, have received their instructions from the King this day; they being to begin their journey towards their treaty at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10869/">Bredagh</a> speedily, their passes being come. Here I saw the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11003/">Lady Northumberland</a> and her <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/11004/">daughter-in-law</a>, my Lord Treasurer&#8217;s daughter, my Lady Piercy, a beautiful lady indeed. So away back by water, and left Balty at White Hall and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin</a> &#8230; and so by coach home, and there to my chamber, and then to supper and bed, having not had time to make up my accounts of this month at this very day, but will in a day or two, and pay my forfeit for not doing it, though business hath most hindered me.</p>

<p>The month shuts up only with great desires of peace in all of us, and a belief that we shall have a peace, in most people, if a peace can be had on any terms, for there is a necessity of it; for we cannot go on with the war, and our masters are afraid to come to depend upon the good will of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> any more, as I do hear.</p>
