By and by, they went away, and then we were at rest again; and so, the play being done, we to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2594/">Islington</a>, and there eat and drank and mighty merry; and so home singing, and, after a letter or two at the office, to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Some of our mayds sitting up late last night to get things ready against our feast to-day, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a> called us up about three in the morning, to tell us of a great <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">fire</a> they saw in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>. So I rose and slipped on my nightgowne, and went to her window, and thought it to be on the backside of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3333/">Marke-lane</a> at the farthest; but, being unused to such fires as followed, I thought it far enough off; and so went to bed again and to sleep. About seven rose again to dress myself, and there looked out at the window, and saw the fire not so much as it was and further off. So to my closett to set things to rights after yesterday&#8217;s cleaning. By and by Jane comes and tells me that she hears that above 300 houses have been burned down to-night by the fire we saw, and that it is now burning down all <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/175/">Fish-street</a>, by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/244/">London Bridge</a>. So I made myself ready presently, and walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>, and there got up upon one of the high places, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1156/">Sir J. Robinson&#8217;s</a> little son going up with me; and there I did see the houses at that end of the bridge all on fire, and an infinite great fire on this and the other side the end of the bridge; which, among other people, did trouble me for poor little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Michell</a> and our Sarah on the bridge. So down, with my heart full of trouble, to the Lieutenant of the Tower, who tells me that it begun this morning in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10873/">the King&#8217;s baker&#8217;s</a> house in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10312/">Pudding-lane</a>, and that it hath burned <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10313/">St. Magnus&#8217;s Church</a> and most part of Fish-street already. So I down to the water-side, and there got a boat and through bridge, and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michell&#8217;s house, as far as the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>, already burned that way, and the fire running further, that in a very little time it got as far as the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10314/">Steeleyard</a>, while I was there. Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the river</a> or bringing them into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/">lighters</a> that layoff; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another. And among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they were, some of them burned, their wings, and fell down.</p>

<p>Having staid, and in an hour&#8217;s time seen the fire: rage every way, and nobody, to my sight, endeavouring to quench it, but to remove their goods, and leave all to the fire, and having seen it get as far as the Steele-yard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into the City; and every thing, after so long a drought, proving combustible, even the very stones of churches, and among other things the poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10315/">steeple</a> by which pretty <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8107/">Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</a> lives, and whereof my old school-fellow <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/942/">Elborough</a> is parson, taken fire in the very top, an there burned till it fell down: I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> (with a gentleman with me who desired to go off from the Tower, to see the fire, in my boat); to White Hall, and there up to the Kings closett in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1042/">Chappell</a>, where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>. So I was called for, and did tell the King and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> what I saw, and that unless his Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to go to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5187/">Lord Mayor</a> &#8212;[Sir Thomas Bludworth. See <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/06/30/">June 30th, 1666</a>.]&#8212; from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way. The Duke of York bid me tell him that if he would have any more soldiers he shall; and so did my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> afterwards, as a great secret.<sup id="fnr1-1666-09-02"><a href="#fn1-1666-09-02">1</a></sup> Here meeting, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a>, I in his coach, which he lent me, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> with me to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/">Paul&#8217;s</a>, and there walked along <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10316/">Watlingstreet</a>, as well as I could, every creature coming away loaden with goods to save, and here and there sicke people carried away in beds. Extraordinary good goods carried in carts and on backs. At last met my Lord Mayor in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1324/">Canningstreet</a>, like a man spent, with a handkercher about his neck. To the King&#8217;s message he cried, like a fainting woman, &#8220;Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.&#8221; That he needed no more soldiers; and that, for himself, he must go and refresh himself, having been up all night. So he left me, and I him, and walked <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, seeing people all almost distracted, and no manner of means used to quench the fire. The houses, too, so very thick thereabouts, and full of matter for burning, as pitch and tarr, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1233/">Thames-street</a>; and warehouses of oyle, and wines, and brandy, and other things. Here I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9623/">Mr. Isaake Houblon</a>, the handsome man, prettily dressed and dirty, at his door at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10317/">Dowgate</a>, receiving some of his brothers&#8217; things, whose houses were on fire; and, as he says, have been removed twice already; and he doubts (as it soon proved) that they must be in a little time removed from his house also, which was a sad consideration. And to see the churches all filling with goods by people who themselves should have been quietly there at this time.</p>

<p>By this time it was about twelve o&#8217;clock; and so home, and there find my guests, which was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10246/">Mr. Wood</a> and his wife <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8955/">Barbary Sheldon</a>, and also <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9606/">Mr. Moons</a>: she mighty fine, and her husband; for aught I see, a likely man. But Mr. Moone&#8217;s design and mine, which was to look over my closett and please him with the sight thereof, which he hath long desired, was wholly disappointed; for we were in great trouble and disturbance at this fire, not knowing what to think of it. However, we had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be.</p>

<p>While at dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10244/">Mrs. Batelier</a> come to enquire after <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10318/">Mr. Woolfe</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7262/">Stanes</a> (who, it seems, are related to them), whose houses in Fish-street are all burned; and they in a sad condition. She would not stay in the fright.</p>

<p>Soon as dined, I and Moone away, and walked, through the City, the streets full of nothing but people and horses and carts loaden with goods, ready to run over one another, and, removing goods from one burned house to another. They now removing out of Canning-streets (which received goods in the morning) into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard-streets</a>, and further; and among others I now saw my little goldsmith, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9584/">Stokes</a>, receiving some friend&#8217;s goods, whose house itself was burned the day after. We parted at Paul&#8217;s; he home, and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4041/">Paul&#8217;s Wharf</a>, where I had appointed a boat to attend me, and took in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8833/">Mr. Carcasse</a> and his brother, whom I met in the streets and carried them below and above bridge to and again to see the fire, which was now got further, both below and above and no likelihood of stopping it. Met with the King and Duke of York in their barge, and with them to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2302/">Queenhith</a> and there called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1348/">Sir Richard Browne</a> to them. Their order was only to pull down houses apace, and so below bridge the water-side; but little was or could be done, the fire coming upon them so fast. Good hopes there was of stopping it at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2979/">Three Cranes</a> above, and at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10320/">Buttolph&#8217;s Wharf</a> below bridge, if care be used; but the wind carries it into the City so as we know not by the water-side what it do there. River full of lighters and boats taking in goods, and good goods swimming in the water, and only I observed that hardly one lighter or boat in three that had the goods of a house in, but there was a pair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1673/">Virginalls</a> in it. Having seen as much as I could now, I away to White Hall by appointment, and there walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">St. James&#8217;s Parks</a>, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> and Wood and his wife, and walked to my boat; and there upon the water again, and to the fire up and down, it still encreasing, and the wind great. So near the fire as we could for smoke; and all over the Thames, with one&#8217;s face in the wind, you were almost burned with a shower of firedrops. This is very true; so as houses were burned by these drops and flakes of fire, three or four, nay, five or six houses, one from another. When we could endure no more upon the water; we to a little ale-house on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10321/">the Bankside</a>, over against the Three Cranes, and there staid till it was dark almost, and saw the fire grow; and, as it grew darker, appeared more and more, and in corners and upon steeples, and between churches and houses, as far as we could see up the hill of the City, in a most horrid malicious bloody flame, not like the fine flame of an ordinary fire. <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Barbary</a> and <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9484/">her husband</a> away before us. We staid till, it being darkish, we saw the fire as only one entire arch of fire from this to the other side the bridge, and in a bow up the hill for an arch of above a mile long: it made me weep to see it. The churches, houses, and all on fire and flaming at once; and a horrid noise the flames made, and the cracking of houses at their ruins. So home with a sad heart, and there find every body discoursing and lamenting the fire; and poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Tom Hater</a> come with some few of his goods saved out of his house, which is burned upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/175/">Fish-streets Hill</a>. I invited him to lie at my house, and did receive his goods, but was deceived in his lying there, the newes coming every moment of the growth of the fire; so as we were forced to begin to pack up our owne goods; and prepare for their removal; and did by moonshine (it being brave dry, and moon shine, and warm weather) carry much of my goods into the garden, and Mr. Hater and I did remove my money and iron chests into my cellar, as thinking that the safest place. And got my bags of gold into my office, ready to carry away, and my chief papers of accounts also there, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> into a box by themselves. So great was our fear, as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> hath carts come out of the country to fetch away his goods this night. We did put Mr. Hater, poor man, to bed a little; but he got but very little rest, so much noise being in my house, taking down of goods.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>About four o&#8217;clock in the morning, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">Lady Batten</a> sent me a cart to carry away all my money, and plate, and best things, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider&#8217;s</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6421/">Bednall-greene</a>. Which I did riding myself in my night-gowne in the cart; and, Lord! to see how the streets and the highways are crowded with people running and riding, and getting of carts at any rate to fetch away things. I find Sir W. Rider tired with being called up all night, and receiving things from several friends. His house full of goods, and much of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a>. I am eased at my heart to have my treasure so well secured. Then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, with much ado to find a way, nor any sleep all this night to me nor my poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">wife</a>. But then and all this day she and I, and all my people labouring to get away the rest of our things, and did get <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7645/">Mr. Tooker</a> to get me a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/">lighter</a> to take them in, and we did carry them (myself some) over <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/">Tower Hill</a>, which was by this time full of people&#8217;s goods, bringing their goods thither; and down to the lighter, which lay at next quay, above the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5178/">Tower Docke</a>. And here was <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8716/">my neighbour&#8217;s</a> wife, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5624/">Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</a>, with her <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13624/">pretty child</a>, and some few of her things, which I did willingly give way to be saved with mine; but there was no passing with any thing through the postern, the crowd was so great.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> of this day by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and spoke to us, and did ride with his guard up and down <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>, to keep all quiet (he being now Generall, and having the care of all).</p>

<p>This day, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> being not at home, but against her mistress&#8217;s order gone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7967/">her mother&#8217;s</a>, and my wife going thither to speak with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a>, met her there, and was angry; and her mother saying that she was not a &#8217;prentice girl, to ask leave every time she goes abroad, my wife with good reason was angry, and, when she came home, bid her be gone again. And so she went away, which troubled me, but yet less than it would, because of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">condition</a> we are in, fear of coming into in a little time of being less able to keepe one in her quality. At night lay down a little upon a quilt of W. Hewer&#8217;s in the office, all my owne things being packed up or gone; and after me my poor wife did the like, we having fed upon the remains of yesterday&#8217;s dinner, having no fire nor dishes, nor any opportunity of dressing any thing.</p>

		<p>Up by break of day to get away the remainder of my things; which I did by a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/">lighter</a> at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10336/">Iron gate</a> and my hands so few, that it was the afternoon before we could get them all away.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1117/">Tower-streete</a>, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a> burning three or four doors beyond <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2999/">Mr. Howell&#8217;s</a>, whose goods, poor man, his trayes, and dishes, shovells, &amp;c., were flung all along Tower-street in the kennels, and people working therewith from one end to the other; the fire coming on in that narrow streete, on both sides, with infinite fury. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> not knowing how to remove his <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a>, did dig a pit in the garden, and laid it in there; and I took the opportunity of laying all the papers of my office that I could not otherwise dispose of. And in the evening Sir W. Pen and I did dig another, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1065/">cheese</a>, as well as my wine and some other things.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> was at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> this day, at Sir W. Pen&#8217;s; but I happened not to be within. This afternoon, sitting melancholy with Sir W. Pen in our garden, and thinking of the certain burning of this office, without extraordinary means, I did propose for the sending up of all our workmen from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> yards (none whereof yet appeared), and to write to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> to have the Duke of Yorke&#8217;s permission to pull down houses, rather than lose this office, which would, much hinder, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> business. So Sir W. Pen he went down this night, in order to the sending them up to-morrow morning; and I wrote to Sir W. Coventry about the business, but received no answer.<sup id="fnr1-1666-09-04"><a href="#fn1-1666-09-04">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This night <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3028/">Mrs. Turner</a> (who, poor woman, was removing her goods all this day, good goods into the garden, and knows not how to dispose of them), and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/921/">her husband</a> supped with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I at night, in the office; upon a shoulder of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1740/">mutton</a> from the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1044/">cook&#8217;s</a>, without any napkin or any thing, in a sad manner, but were merry. Only now and then walking into the garden, and saw how horridly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was enough to put us out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks just as if it was at us; and the whole heaven on fire. I after supper walked in the darke down to Tower-streete, and there saw it all on fire, at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6390/">Trinity House</a> on that side, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/922/">Dolphin Taverne</a> on this side, which was very near us; and the fire with extraordinary vehemence. Now begins the practice of blowing up of houses in Tower-streete, those next <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>, which at first did frighten people more than anything, but it stopped the fire where it was done, it bringing down the houses to the ground in the same places they stood, and then it was easy to quench what little fire was in it, though it kindled nothing almost. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> this day went to see how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1161/">his mother</a> did, and comes late home, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2594/">Islington</a>, her house in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10337/">Pye-corner</a> being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way, and all the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10338/">Old Bayly</a>, and was running down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleete-streete</a>; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/">Paul&#8217;s</a> is burned, and all <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/141/">Cheapside</a>. I wrote to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> this night, but the post-house being burned, the letter could not go.<sup id="fnr2-1666-09-04"><a href="#fn2-1666-09-04">2</a></sup></p>

		<p>I lay down in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> again upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer&#8217;s</a>, quilt, being mighty weary, and sore in my feet with going till I was hardly able to stand. About two in the morning <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> calls me up and tells me of new cryes of fire, it being come to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/681/">Barkeing Church</a>, which is the bottom of our lane. I up, and finding it so, resolved presently to take her away, and did, and took my gold, which was about 2350<i>l.</i>, W. Hewer, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a>, down by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10148/">Proundy&#8217;s</a> boat to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>; but, Lord! what sad sight it was by moone-light to see, the whole <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">City</a> almost on fire, that you might see it plain at Woolwich, as if you were by it. There, when I come, I find the gates shut, but no guard kept at all, which troubled me, because of discourse now begun, that there is plot in it, and that the French had done it. I got the gates open, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5055/">Mr. Shelden&#8217;s</a>, where I locked up my gold, and charged my wife and W. Hewer never to leave the room without one of them in it, night, or day. So back again, by the way seeing my goods well in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/">lighters</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, and watched well by people. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">Home</a>; and whereas I expected to have seen our house on fire, it being now about seven o&#8217;clock, it was not. But to the fyre, and there find greater hopes than I expected; for my confidence of finding our Office on fire was such, that I durst not ask any body how it was with us, till I come and saw it not burned. But going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a>, I find by the blowing up of houses, and the great helpe given by the workmen out of the King&#8217;s yards, sent up by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, there is a good stop given to it, as well as at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3333/">Marke-lane</a> end as ours; it having only burned the dyall of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/681/">Barking Church</a>, and part of the porch, and was there quenched. I up to the top of Barking steeple, and there saw the saddest sight of desolation that I ever saw; every where great fires, oyle-cellars, and brimstone, and other things burning. I became afeard to stay there long, and therefore down again as fast as I could, the fire being spread as far as I could see it; and to Sir W. Pen&#8217;s, and there eat a piece of cold meat, having eaten nothing since Sunday, but the remains of Sunday&#8217;s dinner.</p>

<p>Here I met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2515/">Mr. Young</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6293/">Whistler</a>; and having removed all my things, and received good hopes that the fire at our end is stopped, they and I walked into the town, and find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1075/">Fanchurch-streete</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5645/">Gracious-streete</a>; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/966/">Lumbard-streete</a> all in dust. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">The Exchange</a> a sad sight, nothing standing there, of all the statues or pillars, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10349/">Sir Thomas Gresham&#8217;s</a> picture in the corner. Walked into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2188/">Moorefields</a> (our feet ready to burn, walking through the towne among the hot coles), and find that full of people, and poor wretches carrying their good there, and every body keeping his goods together by themselves (and a great blessing it is to them that it is fair weather for them to keep abroad night and day); drank there, and paid two-pence for a plain penny <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/394/">loaf</a>.</p>

<p>Thence homeward, having passed through <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/141/">Cheapside</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5730/">Newgate Market</a>, all burned, and seen <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1107/">Anthony Joyce&#8217;s</a> House in fire. And took up (which I keep by me) a piece of glasse of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1839/">Mercers&#8217; Chappell</a> in the streete, where much more was, so melted and buckled with the heat of the fire like parchment. I also did see a poor cat taken out of a hole in the chimney, joyning to the wall of the Exchange; with, the hair all burned off the body, and yet alive. So home at night, and find there good hopes of saving our office; but great endeavours of watching all night, and having men ready; and so we lodged them in the office, and had drink and bread and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1065/">cheese</a> for them. And I lay down and slept a good night about midnight, though when I rose I heard that there had been a great alarme of French and Dutch being risen, which proved, nothing. But it is a strange thing to see how long this time did look since Sunday, having been always full of variety of actions, and little sleep, that it looked like a week or more, and I had forgot, almost the day of the week.</p>

		<p>Up about five o&#8217;clock, and where met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/994/">Mr. Gawden</a> at the gate of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> (I intending to go out, as I used, every now and then to-day, to see how the fire is) to call our men to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2191/">Bishop&#8217;s-gate</a>, where no fire had yet been near, and there is now one broke out which did give great grounds to people, and to me too, to think that there is some kind of plot<sup id="fnr1-1666-09-06"><a href="#fn1-1666-09-06">1</a></sup> in this (on which many by this time have been taken, and, it hath been dangerous for any stranger to walk in the streets), but I went with the men, and we did put it out in a little time; so that that was well again. It was pretty to see how hard the women did work in the cannells, sweeping of water; but then they would scold for drink, and be as drunk as devils. I saw good butts of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/386/">sugar</a> broke open in the street, and people go and take handsfull out, and put into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/308/">beer</a>, and drink it. And now all being pretty well, I took boat, and over to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1284/">Southwarke</a>, and took boat on the other side the bridge, and so to Westminster, thinking to shift myself, being all in dirt from top to bottom; but could not there find any place to buy a shirt or pair of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13924/">gloves</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> being full of people&#8217;s goods, those in Westminster having removed all their goods, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/290/">Exchequer</a> money put into vessels to carry to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6560/">Nonsuch</a>; but to the Swan, and there was trimmed; and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, but saw nobody; and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>. A sad sight to see how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a> looks: no houses nor church near it, to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">Temple</a>, where it stopped. At home, did go with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, and our neighbour, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3672/">Knightly</a> (who, with one more, was the only man of any fashion left in all the neighbourhood thereabouts, they all removing their goods and leaving their houses to the mercy of the fire), to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir R. Ford&#8217;s</a>, and there dined in an earthen platter &#8212; a fried breast of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1740/">mutton</a>; a great many of us, but very merry, and indeed as good a meal, though as ugly a one, as ever I had in my life. Thence down to Deptford, and there with great satisfaction landed all my goods at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> safe, and nothing missed I could see, or hurt. This being done to my great content, I home, and to Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, and there with Sir R. Ford, Mr. Knightly, and one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10350/">Withers</a>, a professed lying rogue, supped well, and mighty merry, and our fears over. From them to the office, and there slept with the office full of labourers, who talked, and slept, and walked all night long there. But strange it was to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/996/">Cloathworkers&#8217; Hall</a> on fire these three days and nights in one body of flame, it being the cellar full of oyle.</p>

		<p>Up by five o&#8217;clock; and, blessed be God! find all well, and by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4041/">Paul&#8217;s Wharfe</a>. Walked thence, and saw, all the towne burned, and a miserable sight of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/">Paul&#8217;s church</a>; with all the roofs fallen, and the body of the quire fallen into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10394/">St. Fayth&#8217;s</a>; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1597/">Paul&#8217;s school</a> also, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1538/">Ludgate</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleet-street</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father&#8217;s</a> house, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1224/">the church</a>, and a good part of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">the Temple</a> the like. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed&#8217;s</a> lodging, near the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, and there find him laid down upon a bed; the house all unfurnished, there being fears of the fire&#8217;s coming to them. There borrowed a shirt of him, and washed. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, who lay without curtains, having removed all his goods; as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and every body had done, and was doing. He hopes we shall have no publique distractions upon this fire, which is what every body fears, because of the talke of the French having a hand in it. And it is a proper time for discontents; but all men&#8217;s minds are full of care to protect themselves, and save their goods: the militia is in armes every where. Our fleetes, he tells me, have been in sight one of another, and most unhappily by fowle weather were parted, to our great losse, as in reason they do conclude; the Dutch being come out only to make a shew, and please their people; but in very bad condition as to stores; victuals, and men. They are at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10351/">Bullen</a>; and our fleete come to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9999/">St. Ellen&#8217;s</a>. We have got nothing, but have lost one ship, but he knows not what.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1050/">the Swan</a>, and there drank: and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and find all well. My <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, and tells us <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">the Generall</a> is sent for up, to come to advise with the King about business at this juncture, and to keep all quiet; which is great honour to him, but I am sure is but a piece of dissimulation. So home, and did give orders for my house to be made clean; and then down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>, and there find all well. Dined, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7909/">Mrs. Markham</a> come to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>. So I up again, and calling at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> for some things of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer&#8217;s</a>, he being with me, and then home and spent the evening with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir R. Ford</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3672/">Mr. Knightly</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> at Sir W. Batten&#8217;s. This day our Merchants first met at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, which, by proclamation, is to be their Exchange. Strange to hear what is bid for houses all up and down here; a friend of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider&#8217;s</a>: having 150<i>l.</i> for what he used to let for 40<i>l.</i> per annum. Much dispute where the Custome-house shall be thereby the growth of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> again to be foreseen. My <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a>, they say, and others; would have it at the other end of the towne. I home late to Sir W. Pen&#8217;s, who did give me a bed; but without curtains or hangings, all being down. So here I went the first time into a naked bed, only my drawers on; and did sleep pretty well: but still hath sleeping and waking had a fear of fire in my heart, that I took little rest. People do all the world over cry out of the simplicity of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5187/">Lord Mayor</a> in generall; and more particularly in this business of the fire, laying it all upon him. A proclamation<sup id="fnr1-1666-09-07"><a href="#fn1-1666-09-07">1</a></sup> is come out for markets to be kept at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3369/">Leadenhall</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7710/">Mileendgreene</a>, and several other places about the towne; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1395/">Tower-hill</a>, and all churches to be set open to receive poor people.</p>

		<p>Up and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> and they to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>. I stopped with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> to desire him to go with us, and to enquire after money. But the first he cannot do, and the other as little, or says, &#8220;when we can get any, or what shall we do for it?&#8221; He, it seems, is employed in the correspondence between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> every day, in settling of things. I find him full of trouble, to think how things will go. I left him, and to St. James&#8217;s, where we met first at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a> chamber, and there did what business we can, without any books. Our discourse, as every thing else, was confused. The fleete is at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1764/">Portsmouth</a>, there staying a wind to carry them to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1257/">Downes</a>, or towards <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10351/">Bullen</a>, where they say the Dutch fleete is gone, and stays. We concluded upon private meetings for a while, not having any money to satisfy any people that may come to us. I bought two <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/375/">eeles</a> upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the Thames</a>, cost me six shillings. Thence with Sir W. Batten to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/179/">Cock-pit</a>, whither the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> is come. It seems the King holds him so necessary at this time, that he hath sent for him, and will keep him here. Indeed, his interest in the City, being acquainted, and his care in keeping things quiet, is reckoned that wherein he will be very serviceable. We to him; he is courted in appearance by every body. He very kind to us; I perceive he lays by all business of the fleete at present, and minds the City, and is now hastening to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, to discourse with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4912/">Aldermen</a>. Sir W. Batten and I home (where met by my brother <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">John</a>, come to town to see how things are with us), and then presently he with me to Gresham College; where infinity of people, partly through novelty to see the new place, and partly to find out and hear what is become one man of another. I met with many people undone, and more that have extraordinary great losses. People speaking their thoughts variously about the beginning of the fire, and the rebuilding of the City. Then to Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, and took my brother with me, and there dined with a great company of neighbours; and much good discourse; among others, of the low spirits of some rich men in the City, in sparing any encouragement to the poor people that wrought for the saving their houses. Among others, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10352/">Alderman Starling</a>, a very rich man, without children, the fire at next door to him in our lane, after our men had saved his house, did give 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> among thirty of them, and did quarrel with some that would remove the rubbish out of the way of the fire, saying that they come to steal. Sir W. Coventry told me of another this morning, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/530/">Holborne</a>, which he shewed the King that when it was offered to stop the fire near his house for such a reward that came but to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a man among the neighbours he would, give but 18<i>d.</i> Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6421/">Bednall Green</a> by coach, my brother with me, and saw all well there, and fetched away my journall book to enter for five days past, and then back to the office where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell&#8217;s wife</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6479/">her husband</a> come home. Agreed to come to their house to-morrow, I sending him away to his ship to-day. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> and late writing letters, and then to Sir W. Pen&#8217;s, my brother lying with me, and Sir W. Pen gone down to rest himself at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>. But I was much frighted and kept awake in my bed, by some noise I heard a great while below stairs; and the boys not coming up to me when I knocked. It was by their discovery of people stealing of some neighbours&#8217; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> that lay in vessels in the streets. So to sleep; and all well all night.</p>

		<p>(Sunday). Up and was trimmed, and sent <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, to dine with her. I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, where our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1215/">parson</a> made a melancholy but good sermon; and many and most in the church cried, specially the women. The church mighty full; but few of fashion, and most strangers. I walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6421/">Bednall Green</a>, and there dined well, but a bad <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/384/">venison pasty</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider&#8217;s</a>. Good people they are, and good discourse; and his daughter, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6422/">Middleton</a>, a fine woman, discreet. Thence home, and to church again, and there preached <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/808/">Dean Harding</a>; but, methinks, a bad, poor sermon, though proper for the time; nor eloquent, in saying at this time that the City is reduced from a large folio to a decimotertio. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, there to write down my journall, and take leave of my brother, whom I sent back this afternoon, though rainy; which it hath not done a good while before. But I had no room or convenience for him here till my house is fitted; but I was very kind to him, and do take very well of him his journey. I did give him 40<i>s.</i> for his pocket, and so, he being gone, and, it presently rayning, I was troubled for him, though it is good for the fyre. Anon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a> to bed, and made my boy Tom to read me asleep.</p>

		<p>All the morning clearing our cellars, and breaking in pieces all my old lumber, to make room, and to prevent fire. And then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a>, and dined; and there hear that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider</a> says that the towne is full of the report of the wealth that is in his house, and would be glad that his friends would provide for the safety of their goods there. This made me get a cart; and thither, and there brought my money all away. Took a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/575/">hackney-coach</a> myself (the hackney-coaches now standing at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/246/">Allgate</a>). Much wealth indeed there is at his house. Blessed be God, I got all mine well thence, and lodged it in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>; but vexed to have all the world see it. And with Sir W. Batten, who would have taken away my hands before they were stowed. But by and by comes brother <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> from sea, which I was glad of; and so got him, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7645/">Mr. Tooker</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">the boy</a>, to watch with them all in the office all night, while I upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane&#8217;s</a> coming went down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, calling at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, intending to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell</a>, but did not &#8216;ouvrir la porte comme je&#8217; did expect. So down late to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a>, and there find my wife out of humour and indifferent, as she uses upon her having much liberty abroad.</p>

		<p>Lay there, and up betimes, and by water with my gold, and laid it with the rest in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, where I find all well and safe. So with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W.

Coventry</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> met. Little business before us but want of money. Broke up, and I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by coach round the town. Dined at home, Balty and myself putting up my papers in my closet in the office. He away, I down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> and there spoke with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell</a> and agreed upon to-morrow, and come home in the rain by water. In the evening at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a>; with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, at supper, he in a mad, ridiculous, drunken humour; and it seems there have been some late distances between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">his lady</a> and him, as my [wife] tells me. After supper, I home, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Mr. Hater</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9465/">Gibson</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">Tom</a> alone, got all my chests and money into the further cellar with much pains, but great content to me when done. So very late and weary, to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and to work, having carpenters come to helpe in setting up bedsteads and hangings; and at that trade my people and I all the morning, till pressed by publique business to leave them against my will in the afternoon: and yet I was troubled in being at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, to see all my goods lie up and down the house in a bad condition, and strange workmen going to and fro might take what they would almost. All the afternoon busy; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> come to me, and found me, as God would have it, in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and people about me setting my papers to rights; and there discoursed about getting an account ready against the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>, and thereby did create me infinite of business, and to be done on a sudden; which troubled me: but, however, he being gone, I about it late, and to good purpose. And so home, having this day also got my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> out of the ground again, and set in my cellar; but with great pain to keep the porters that carried it in from observing the money-chests there. So to bed as last night, only <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I upon a bedstead with curtains in that which was Mercer&#8217;s chamber, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/">his wife</a> (who are here and do us good service), where we lay last night.

		<p>All the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6860/">Harman</a> being come to my great satisfaction to put up my beds and hangings, so I am at rest, and followed my business all day. Dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, mighty busy about this account, and while my people were busy, wrote near thirty letters and orders with my owne hand. At it till eleven at night; and it is strange to see how clear my head was, being eased of all the matter of all these letters; whereas one would think that I should have been dazed. I never did observe so much of myself in my life. In the evening there comes to me <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a>, and walked a good while in the garden. He says he hath computed that the rents of houses lost by this fire in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> comes to 600,000<i>l.</i> per annum; that this will make <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">the Parliament</a>, more quiet than otherwise they would have been, and give <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> a more ready supply; that the supply must be by excise, as it is in Holland; that the Parliament will see it necessary to carry on the warr; that the late storm hindered our beating the Dutch fleete, who were gone out only to satisfy the people, having no business to do but to avoid us; that the French, as late in the yeare as it is, are coming; that the Dutch are really in bad condition, but that this unhappinesse of ours do give them heart; that there was a late difference between my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> about neglect in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10467/">the last</a> to send away an express of the other&#8217;s in time; that it come before the King, and the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> concerned himself in it; but this fire hath stopped it. The Dutch fleete is not gone home, but rather to the North, and so dangerous to our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9624/">Gottenburgh</a> fleete. That the Parliament is likely to fall foul upon some persons; and, among others, on the Vice-chamberlaine, though we both believe with little ground. That certainly never so great a loss as this was borne so well by citizens in the world; he believing that not one merchant upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> will break upon it. That he do not apprehend there will be any disturbances in State upon it; for that all men are busy in looking after their owne business to save themselves. He gone, I to finish my letters, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to bed; and find to my infinite joy many rooms clean; and myself and wife lie in our own chamber again. But much terrified in the nights now-a-days with dreams of fire, and falling down of houses.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Lay with much pleasure in bed talking with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Mr. Hater&#8217;s</a> lying here and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W.

At noon, with my wife, against her will, all undressed and dirty, dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen&#8217;s</a>, where was all the company of our families in towne; but, Lord! so sorry a dinner: <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/383/">venison</a> baked in pans, that the dinner I have had for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">his lady</a> alone hath been worth four of it. Thence, after dinner, displeased with our entertainment, to my office again, and there till almost midnight and my people with me, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, my head mightily akeing about our accounts.</p>

		<p>Up betimes, and shaved myself after a week&#8217;s growth, but, Lord! how ugly I was yesterday and how fine to-day! By water, seeing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> all the way, a sad sight indeed, much <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">fire</a> being still in. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, and there read over my yesterday&#8217;s work: being a collection of the particulars of the excess of charge created by a war, with good content. Sir W. Coventry was in great pain lest the French fleete should be passed by our fleete, who had notice of them on Saturday, and were preparing to go meet them; but their minds altered, and judged them merchant-men, when the same day the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10390/">Success</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10030/">Captain Ball</a>, made their whole fleete, and come to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/839/">Brighthelmstone</a>, and thence at five o&#8217;clock afternoon, Saturday, wrote Sir W. Coventry newes thereof; so that we do much fear our missing them. Here come in and talked with him <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7945/">Sir Thomas Clifford</a>, who appears a very fine gentleman, and much set by at Court for his activity in going to sea, and stoutness everywhere, and stirring up and down. Thence by coach over the ruines, down <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/127/">Fleete Streete</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/141/">Cheapside</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1024/">Broad Streete</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> (and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, whom I had not seen a long time before, being his first coming abroad) and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> passing his accounts. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> a little to look after my people at work and back to Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s to dinner; and thence, after some discourse; with him upon our publique accounts, I back home, and all the day with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6860/">Harman</a> and his people finishing the hangings and beds in my house, and the hangings will be as good as ever, and particularly in my new closet. They gone and I weary, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">his wife</a>, who come hither to-day to helpe us, to a barrel of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/">oysters</a> I sent from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the river</a> today, and so to bed.</p>

		<p>Strange with what freedom and quantity I pissed this night, which I know not what to impute to but my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/">oysters</a>, unless the coldness of the night should cause it, for it was a sad rainy and tempestuous night. Soon as up I begun to have some pain in my bladder and belly, as usual, which made me go to dinner betimes, to fill my belly, and that did ease me, so as I did my business in the afternoon, in forwarding the settling of my house, very well. Betimes to bed, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> also being all this day ill in the same manner. Troubled at my wife&#8217;s haire coming off so much. This day the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> met, and adjourned till Friday, when <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> will be with them.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, and there did our usual business before the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a>; which signified little, our business being only complaints of lack of money. Here I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10375/">a bastard</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10376/">the late King of Sweden&#8217;s</a> come to kiss his hands; a mighty modish French-like gentleman. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and Sir W. Pen, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5878/">Wilkes&#8217;s</a>; and there did hear the many profane stories of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6885/">Sir Henry Wood</a> damning the parsons for so much spending the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> at the sacrament, cursing that ever they took the cup to themselves, and then another story that he valued not all the world&#8217;s curses, for two pence he shall get at any time the prayers of some poor body that is worth a 1000 of all their curses; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/645/">Lord Norwich</a> drawing a tooth at a health. Another time, he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10377/">Pinchbacke</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10378/">Dr. Goffe</a>, now a religious man, Pinchbacke did begin a frolick to drink out of a glass with a toad in it that he had taken up going out to shit, he did it without harm. Goffe, who knew sacke would kill the toad, called for sacke; and when he saw it dead, says he, &#8220;I will have a quick toad, and will not drink from a dead toad.&#8221;<sup id="fnr1-1666-09-02"><a href="#fn1-1666-09-02">1</a></sup> By that means, no other being to be found, he escaped the health. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and dined, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> and got all my pictures put into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10359/">wherries</a>, and my other fine things, and landed them all very well, and brought them home, and got <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5547/">Sympson</a> to set them all up to-night; and he gone, I and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">the boy</a> to finish and set up my books, and everything else in my house, till two o&#8217;clock in the morning, and then to bed; but mightily troubled, and even in my sleep, at my missing four or five of my biggest books. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4963/">Speed&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10379/">Chronicle</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10380/">Maps</a>, and the two parts of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6534/">Waggoner</a>, and a book of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/797/">cards</a>, which I suppose I have put up with too much care, that I have forgot where they are; for sure they are not stole. Two little pictures of sea and ships and a little gilt frame belonging to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6261/">plate</a> of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a>, I want; but my books do heartily trouble me. Most of my gilt frames are hurt, which also troubles me, but most my books. This day I put on two shirts, the first time this year, and do grow well upon it; so that my disease is nothing but wind.</p>

		<p>Up, much troubled about my books, but cannot imagine where they should be. Up, to the setting my closet to rights, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> takes me at it, which did not displease me. He and I to discourse about our accounts, and the bringing them to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>, and with much content to see him rely so well on my part. He and I together to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1024/">Broad Streete</a> to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Vice-Chamberlain</a>, and there discoursed a while and parted. My <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/">Lady Carteret</a> come to town, but I did not see her. He tells me how the fleete is come into the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1257/">Downes</a>. Nothing done, nor French fleete seen: we drove all from our anchors. But he says newes is come that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7463/">De Ruyter</a> is dead, or very near it, of a hurt in his mouth, upon the discharge of one of his own guns; which put him into a fever, and he likely to die, if not already dead. We parted, and I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and after dinner to the setting things in order, and all my people busy about the same work. In the afternoon, out by coach, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> with me, which we have not done several weeks now, through all the ruines, to shew her them, which frets her much, and is a sad sight indeed. Set her down at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">her brother&#8217;s</a>, and thence I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a>, and there staid a little while, and called her home. She did give me an account of great differences between <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/">her mother</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">Balty&#8217;s wife</a>. The old woman charges her with going abroad and staying out late, and painting in the absence of her husband, &#8212;[?? D.W.]&#8212; and I know not what; and they grow proud, both he and she, and do not help their <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1067/">father</a> and mother out of what I help them to, which I do not like, nor my wife. So home, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, to even my journall, and then home, and very late up with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/149/">Jane</a> setting my books in perfect order in my closet, but am mightily troubled for my great books that I miss, and I am troubled the more for fear there should be more missing than what I find, though by the room they take on the shelves I do not find any reason to think it. So to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and mightily pleased with the setting of my books the last night in order, and that which did please me most of all is that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> tells me that upon enquiry he do find that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W.

I was impatient to see it, but they were carried into a wine-cellar, and the boy is abroad with him at the House, where the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> met to-day, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> to be with them. At noon after dinner I sent for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5702/">Harry</a>, and he tells me it is so, and brought me by and by my hamper of books to my great joy, with the same books I missed, and three more great ones, and no more. I did give him 5<i>s.</i> for his pains, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> with great joy, and to the setting of some off them right, but could not finish it, but away by coach to the other end of the town, leaving <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, but neither come time enough to the Council to speak with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a>, nor with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, and so called my wife, and paid for some things she bought, and so home, and there after a little doing at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> about our accounts, which now draw near the time they should be ready, the House having ordered Sir G. Carteret, upon his offering them, to bring them in on Saturday next, I home, and there, with great pleasure, very late new setting all my books; and now I am in as good condition as I desire to be in all worldly respects. The Lord of Heaven make me thankfull, and continue me therein! So to bed. This day I had new stairs of main <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a> put to my cellar going into the yard.</p>

		<p>To my closet, and had it new washed, and now <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">my house</a> is so clean as I never saw it, or any other house in my life, and every thing in as good condition as ever before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a>; but with, I believe, about 20<i>l.</i> cost one way or other besides about 20<i>l.</i> charge in removing my goods, and do not find that I have lost any thing but two little pictures of ship and sea, and a little gold frame for one of my sea-cards. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7262/">My glazier</a>, indeed, is so full of worke that I cannot get him to come to perfect my house. To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there busy now for good and all about my accounts. My <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Brunck</a> come thither, thinking to find an office, but we have not yet met. He do now give me a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/715/">watch</a>, a plain one, in the roome of my former watch with many motions which I did give him. If it goes well, I care not for the difference in worth, though believe there is above 5<i>l.</i>. He and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> to discourse about his account, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1313/">Mr. Waith</a> not being there nothing could be done, and therefore I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> again, and busy all day. In the afternoon comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1107/">Anthony Joyce</a> to see me, and with tears told me his losse, but yet that he had something left that he can live well upon, and I doubt it not. But he would buy some place that he could have and yet keepe his trade where he is settled in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9769/">St. Jones&#8217;s</a>. He gone, I to the office again, and then to Sir G. Carteret, and there found Mr. Wayth, but, Lord! how fretfully Sir G. Carteret do discourse with Mr. Wayth about his accounts, like a man that understands them not one word. I held my tongue and let him go on like a passionate foole. In the afternoon I paid for the two <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10207/">lighters</a> that carried my goods to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, and they cost me 8<i>l.</i>. Till past midnight at our accounts, and have brought them to a good issue, so as to be ready to meet Sir G. Carteret and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> to-morrow, but must work to-morrow, which <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Mr. T. Hater</a> had no mind to, it being the Lord&#8217;s day, but, being told the necessity, submitted, poor man! This night writ for brother <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">John</a> to come to towne. Among other reasons, my estate lying in money, I am afeard of any sudden miscarriage. So to bed mightily contented in dispatching so much business, and find my house in the best condition that ever I knew it. Home to bed.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and after being trimmed, all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> with my people about me till about one o&#8217;clock, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and my people with me, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1313/">Mr. Wayth</a> and I eat a bit of victuals in my old closet, now my little dining-room, which makes a pretty room, and my house being so clean makes me mightily pleased, but only I do lacke <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> or somebody in the house to sing with. Soon as eat a bit Mr. Wayth and I by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> lodgings <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> met, and we did debate the whole business of our accounts to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>; where it appears to us that the charge of the war from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/09/01/">September 1st, 1664</a>, to this <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1311/">Michaelmas</a>, will have been but 3,200,000<i>l.</i>, and we have paid in that time somewhat about 2,200,000<i>l.</i>; so that we owe above 900,000<i>l.</i>: but our method of accounting, though it cannot, I believe, be far wide from the mark, yet will not abide a strict examination if the Parliament should be troublesome. Here happened a pretty question of Sir W. Coventry, whether this account of ours will not put my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a> to a difficulty to tell what is become of all the money the Parliament have &#8216;give&#8217; in this time for the war, which hath amounted to about 4,000,000<i>l.</i>, which nobody there could answer; but I perceive they did doubt what his answer could be. Having done, and taken from Sir W. Coventry the minutes of a letter to my Lord Treasurer, Wayth and I back again to the office, and thence back down to the water with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and landed him in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1284/">Southwarke</a>, and my wife and I for pleasure to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6546/">Fox- hall</a>, and there eat and drank, and so back home, and I to the office till midnight drawing the letter we are to send with our accounts to my Lord Treasurer, and that being done to my mind, I home to bed.</p>

Coventry; and at last found him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, consulting how to make up my Lord Treasurer&#8217;s general account, as well as that of the Navy particularly. Here brought the letter, but found that Sir G. Carteret had altered his account since he did give me the abstract of it: so all my letter must be writ over again, to put in his last abstract. So to Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s lodgings, to speak a little about the alteration; and there looking over the book that Sir G. Carteret intends to deliver to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> of his payments since <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1664/09/01/">September 1st, 1664</a>, and there I find my name the very second for flags, which I had bought for the Navy, of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7929/">calico</a>; once, about 500 and odd pounds, which vexed me mightily. At last, I concluded of scraping out my name and putting in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7645/">Mr. Tooker&#8217;s</a>, which eased me; though the price was such as I should have had glory by. Here I saw my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/">Lady Carteret</a> lately come to towne, who, good lady! is mighty kind, and I must make much of her, for she is a most excellent woman. So took up my wife and away home, and there to bed, and&#8230; [Continued <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/25/">tomorrow</a>. P.G.]</p>

		<p>[Continued from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/24/">yesterday.</a> P.G.] &#8230;up betimes, with all my people to get the letter writ over, and other things done, which I did, and by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker&#8217;s</a>, and got his hand to it; and then to the Parliament House and got it signed by the rest, and then delivered it at the House-door to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke</a>; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> being gone into the House with his book of accounts under his arme, to present to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a>. I had brought <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and leaving her with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1101/">Mrs. Michell</a>, where she sat in her shop and had burnt <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/309/">wine</a> sent for her, I walked in the Hall, and among others with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/612/">Ned Pickering</a>, who continues still a lying, bragging <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3533/">coxcombe</a>, telling me that my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> may thank himself for all his misfortune; for not suffering him and two or three good honest fellows more to take them by the throats that spoke ill of him, and told me how basely <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2695/">Lionell Walden</a> hath carried himself towards my Lord; by speaking slightly of him, which I shall remember. Thence took my wife <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1026/">Mr. Hater</a> all the day putting in order and entering in a book all the measures that this account of the Navy hath been made up by, and late at night to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3028/">Mrs. Turner&#8217;s</a>, where she had got my wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">Pegg</a>, and supped, and after, supper and the rest of the company by design gone, Mrs. Turner and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/921/">her husband</a> did lay their case to me about their lodgings, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> being now gone wholly to his owne, and now, they being empty, they doubt <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8284/">Sir T. Harvy</a> or Lord Bruncker may look after the lodgings. I did give them the best advice, poor people, that I could, and would do them any kindnesse, though it is strange that now they should have ne&#8217;er a friend of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> to trust to but me, that they have disobliged. So home to bed, and all night still mightily troubled in my sleepe, with fire and houses pulling down.</p>

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, where every body going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/292/">the House</a>, I away by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and after a few turns, and hearing that our accounts come into the House but to-day, being hindered yesterday by other business, I away by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, taking up <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and calling at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9583/">Bennet&#8217;s</a>, our late mercer, who is come into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/126/">Covent Garden</a> to a fine house looking down upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">the Exchange</a>; and I perceive many Londoners every day come; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/173/">Mr. Pierce</a> hath let <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">his wife&#8217;s</a> closett, and the little blind bed chamber, and a garret to a silke man for 50<i>l.</i> fine, and 30<i>l.</i> per annum, and 40<i>l.</i> per annum more for dieting the master and two prentices. So home, not agreeing for silk for a petticoat for her which she desired, but home to dinner and then back to White Hall, leaving my wife by the way to buy her petticoat of Bennet, and I to White Hall waiting all day on the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> to move <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> for getting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Lanyon</a> some money at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5849/">Plymouth</a> out of some oyle <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prizes</a> brought in thither, but could get nothing done, but here <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3334/">Mr. Dugdale</a> I hear the great loss of books in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/182/">St. Paul&#8217;s Church-yarde</a>, and at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10393/">their Hall</a> also, which they value about 150,000<i>l.</i>; some booksellers being wholly undone, among others, they say, my poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/">Kirton</a>. And <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3667/">Mr. Crumlu</a> all his books and household stuff burned; they trusting <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10394/">St. Fayth&#8217;s</a>, and the roof of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/280/">the church</a> falling, broke the arch down into the lower church, and so all the goods burned. A very great loss. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10392/">His father</a> hath lost above 1000<i>l.</i> in books; one book newly printed, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10395/">a Discourse, it seems, of Courts</a>. Here I had the hap to see my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10044/">Lady Denham</a>: and at night went into the dining-room and saw several fine ladies; among others, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Castlemayne</a>, but chiefly Denham again; and the Duke of Yorke taking her aside and talking to her in the sight of all the world, all alone; which was strange, and what also I did not like. Here I met with good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1033/">Mr. Evelyn</a>, who cries out against it, and calls it bitchering, &#8212;[This word was apparently of Evelyn&#8217;s own making.]&#8212; for the Duke of Yorke talks a little to her, and then she goes away, and then he follows her again like a dog. He observes that none of the nobility come out of the country at all to help the King, or comfort him, or prevent commotions at this fire; but do as if the King were nobody; nor ne&#8217;er a priest comes to give the King and Court good council, or to comfort the poor people that suffer; but all is dead, nothing of good in any of their minds: he bemoans it, and says he fears more ruin hangs over our heads. Thence away by coach, and called away my wife at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>, where she tells me she hath bought a gowne of 15<i>s.</i> per yard; the same, before her face, my Lady Castlemayne this day bought also, which I seemed vexed for, though I do not grudge it her, but to incline her to have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> again, which I believe I shall do, but the girle, I hear, has no mind to come to us again, which vexes me. Being come home, I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, and there hear our business was tendered to the House to-day, and a Committee of the whole House chosen to examine our accounts, and a great many Hotspurs enquiring into it, and likely to give us much trouble and blame, and perhaps (which I am afeard of) will find faults enow to demand better <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1121/">officers</a>. This I truly fear. Away with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, who was there, and he and I walked in the garden by moonlight, and he proposes his and my looking out into Scotland about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a>, and to use <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1230/">Pett</a> there; for timber will be a good commodity this time of building <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a>; and I like the motion, and doubt not that we may do good in it. We did also discourse about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10396/">our Privateer</a>, and hope well of that also, without much hazard, as, if God blesses us, I hope we shall do pretty well toward getting a penny. I was mightily pleased with our discourse, and so parted, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> to finish my journall for three or four days, and so home to supper, and to bed. Our fleete abroad, and the Dutch too, for all we know; the weather very bad; and under the command of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">an unlucky man</a>, I fear. God bless him, and the fleete under him!</p>

		<p>A very furious blowing night all the night; and my mind still mightily perplexed with dreams, and burning the rest of the town, and waking in much pain for the fleete. Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> by coach as far as the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">Temple</a>, and there she to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9583/">mercer&#8217;s</a> again, and I to look out <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9587/">Penny</a>, my tailor, to speak for a cloak and cassock for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/117/">my brother</a>, who is coming to town; and I will have him in a canonical dress, that he may be the fitter to go abroad with me. I then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a>, and there, among other things, spoke to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3671/">Mr. Falconbridge</a> about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8981/">his girle</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/09/21/">I heard sing</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6560/">Nonsuch</a>, and took him and some other &#8217;Chequer men to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">Sun Taverne</a>, and there spent 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> upon them, and he sent for the girle, and she hath a pretty way of singing, but hath almost forgot for want of practice. She is poor in clothes, and not bred to any carriage, but will be soon taught all, and if <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> do not come again, I think we may have her upon better terms, and breed her to what we please. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a>, and there dined with him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1156/">Lieutenant of the Tower</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10398/">Mr. Thin</a>, a pretty gentleman, going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9624/">Gottenburgh</a>. Having dined, Sir W. Coventry, Sir W. Batten, and I walked into his closet to consider of some things more to be done in a list to be given to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> of all our ships, and time of entry and discharge. Sir W. Coventry seems to think they will soon be weary of the business, and fall quietly into the giving <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> what is fit. This he hopes. Thence I by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there intending a meeting, but nobody being there but myself and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, who is worse than nothing, I did not answer any body, but kept to my business in the office till night, and then Sir W. Batten and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> to me, and thence to Sir W. Batten&#8217;s, and eat a barrel of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/373/">oysters</a> I did give them, and so home, and to bed. I have this evening discoursed with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> about Mercer, I having a mind to have her again; and I am vexed to hear him say that she hath no mind to come again, though <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7967/">her mother</a> hath. No newes of the fleete yet, but that they went by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/646/">Dover</a> on the 25th towards the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8540/">Gunfleete</a>, but whether the Dutch be yet abroad, or no, we hear not. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7463/">De Ruyter</a> is not dead, but like to do well. Most think that the gross of the French fleete are gone home again.</p>

		<p>Lay long in bed, and am come to agreement with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> again, on condition she may learn this winter two months to dance, and she promises me she will endeavour to learn to sing, and all this I am willing enough to. So up, and by and by the glazier comes to finish the windows of my house, which pleases me, and the bookbinder to gild the backs of my books. I got the glass of my book-presses to be done presently, which did mightily content me, and to setting my study in a little better order; and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> to my people, busy about our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a> accounts; and so to dinner, and then at them again close. At night comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, and he and I a turn in the garden, and he broke to me a proposition of his and my joining in a design of fetching <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5172/">timber</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4992/">deals</a> from Scotland, by the help of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1230/">Mr. Pett</a> upon the place; which, while London is building, will yield good money. I approve it. We judged a third man, that is knowing, is necessary, and concluded on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, and sent for him to come to us to-morrow morning. I full of this all night, and the project of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10396/">our man of war</a>; but he and I both dissatisfied with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a> proposing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10399/">his son</a> to be Lieutenant, which we, neither of us, like. He gone, I discoursed with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> about Mercer, having a great mind she should come to us again, and instructed him what to say to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7967/">her mother</a> about it. And so home, to supper, and to bed.</p>

We rose soon, and comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a>, by our desire, and with Sir W. Pen and I talked of our Scotch motion, which Sir W. Warren did seem to be stumbled at, and did give no ready answer, but proposed some thing previous to it, which he knows would find us work, or writing to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1230/">Mr. Pett</a> to be informed how matters go there as to cost and ways of providing sawyers or saw-mills. We were parted without coming to any good resolution in it, I discerning plainly that Sir W. Warren had no mind to it, but that he was surprised at our motion. He gone, I to some office business, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then to office again, and then got done by night the lists that are to be presented to the Parliament Committee of the ships, number of men, and time employed since the war, and then I with it (leaving <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a>) to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> staid for me, and I perused our lists, and find to our great joy that wages, victuals, wear and tear, cast by the medium of the men, will come to above 3,000,000; and that the extraordinaries, which all the world will allow us, will arise to more than will justify the expence we have declared to have been at since the war, viz., 320,000<i>l.</i>, he and I being both mightily satisfied, he saying to me, that if God send us over this rub we must take another course for a better <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/485/">Comptroller</a>. So parted, and I to my wife [at Unthanke&#8217;s], who staid for the finishing her new best gowne (the best that ever I made her) coloured <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6418/">tabby</a>, flowered, and so took it and her home; and then I to my people, and having cut them out a little more work than they expected, viz., the writing over the lists in new method, I home to bed, being in good humour, and glad of the end we have brought this matter to.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1666/09/30/">Sunday 30 September 1666</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, where I have not been a good while: and there the church infinitely thronged with strangers since <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10319/">the fire</a> come into our parish; but not one handsome face in all of them, as if, indeed, there was a curse, as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/211/">Bishop Fuller</a> heretofore said, upon our parish. Here I saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> come into the church, which I had a mind to, but she avoided looking up, which vexed me. A pretty good sermon, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> and dined with us. A good dinner; and then to have my haire cut against winter close to my head, and then to church again. A sorry sermon, and away home. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">[Sir] W. Pen</a> and I to walk to talk about several businesses, and then home; and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I to read in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1752/">Fuller&#8217;s Church History</a>, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This month ends with my mind full of business and concernment how this office will speed with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/334/">Parliament</a>, which begins to be mighty severe in the examining our accounts, and the expence of the Navy this war.</p>
