		<p>Up, and all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. At noon, my cozen <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2541/">Thomas Pepys</a> did come to me, to consult about the business of his being a justice of the Peace, which he is much against; and among other reasons, tells me, as a confidant, that he is not free to exercise punishment according to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12784/">the Act</a> against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/305/">Quakers</a> and other people, for religion. Nor do he understand Latin, and so is not capable of the place as formerly, now all warrants do run in Latin. Nor is he in Kent, though he be of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> parish, his house standing in Surry. However, I did bring him to incline towards it, if he be pressed to take it. I do think it may be some repute to me to have my kinsman in Commission there, specially if he behave himself to content in the country.</p>

<p>He gone and<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/"> my wife</a> gone abroad, I out also to and fro, to see and be seen, among others to find out in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1233/">Thames Streete</a> where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Howlett</a> is come to live, being married to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1101/">Mrs. Michell&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">son</a>; which I did about the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4002/">Old Swan</a>, but did not think fit to go thither or see them. Thence by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>, reading a new French book my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a> did give me to-day, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9930/">&#8220;L&#8217;Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules,&#8221;</a> being a pretty libel against the amours of the Court of France. I walked up and down Deptford yarde, where I had not been since I come from living at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a>, which is some months. There I met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2461/">Mr. Castle</a>, and was forced against my will to have his company back with me. So we walked and drank at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4210/">Halfway house</a> and so to his house, where I drank a cupp of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5785/">syder</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2724/">Mr. Norbury</a> newly come to town to see us. After he gone my wife tells me the ill newes that our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">Susan</a> is sicke and gone to bed, with great pain in her head and back, which troubles us all. However we to bed expecting what to-morrow would produce. She hath we conceive wrought a little too much, having neither maid nor girle to help her.</p>

		<p>Up and find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">the girle</a> better, which we are glad of, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> by coach. There attended <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> as usual. Thence with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a>, whom I met there, to London, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, to consult about serving him in getting him some money, he being already tired of his slavery to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, and the charge it costs him, and gets no manner of courtesy from him for it. He gone I <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, find the girle yet better, so no fear of being forced to send her out of doors as we intended. After dinner. I by water to White Hall to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee for Tangier</a> upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7720/">Mr. Yeabsly&#8217;s</a> business, which I got referred to a Committee to examine. Thence among other stops went to my ruler&#8217;s house, and there staid a great while with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9898/">Nan</a> idling away the afternoon with pleasure. By and by home, so to my office a little, and then home to supper with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, the girle being pretty well again, and then to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and all the morning at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and contrary to my expectation find my little girle <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">Su</a> worse than she was, which troubled me, and the more to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> minding her paynting and not thinking of her house business, this being the first day of her beginning the second time to paynt. This together made me froward that I was angry with my wife, and would not have <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8524/">Browne</a> to think to dine at my table with me always, being desirous to have my house to myself without a stranger and a mechanique to be privy to all my concernments. Upon this my wife and I had a little disagreement, but it ended by and by, and then to send up and down for a nurse to take the girle home and would have given anything. I offered to the only one that we could get 20<i>s.</i> per weeke, and we to find clothes, and bedding and physique, and would have given 30<i>s.</i>, as demanded, but desired an houre or two&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>So I away by water to Westminster, and there sent for the girle&#8217;s mother to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> to me; she came and undertakes to get her daughter a lodging and nurse at next doore to her, though she dare not, for the parish&#8217;s sake, whose sexton her husband is, to [have] her into her owne house. Thence home, calling at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/">my bookseller&#8217;s</a> and other trifling places, and in the evening the mother come and with a nurse she has got, who demanded and I did agree at 10<i>s.</i> per weeke to take her, and so she away, and my house mighty uncouth, having so few in it, and we shall want a servant or two by it, and the truth is my heart was a little sad all the afternoon and jealous of myself. But she went, and we all glad of it, and so a little to the office, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up and by water to Westminster to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Cross</a> (<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2748/">Mr. Gregory</a> for company with me) to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke&#8217;s</a>, who was not within. So I took Gregory to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and there spoke with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5908/">Joseph Williamson</a> to have leave in the next <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9931/">Gazette</a> to have a general pay for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5019/">Chest at Chatham</a> declared upon such a day in June. Here I left Gregory, and I by coach back again to Sir Philip Warwicke&#8217;s, and in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">the Park</a> met him walking, so discoursed about the business of striking a quarter&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, due this day, which he hath promised to get my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a> warrant for, and so away hence, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Mr. Hales</a>, to see what he had done to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierces</a> picture, and whatever he pretends, I do not think it will ever be so good a picture as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a>. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> a little and then to dinner, and had a great fray with my wife again about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8524/">Browne&#8217;s</a> coming to teach her to paynt, and sitting with me at table, which I will not yield to. I do thoroughly believe she means no hurte in it; but very angry we were, and I resolved all into my having my will done, without disputing, be the reason what it will; and so I will have it. After dinner abroad again and to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a> about play books, and to White Hall, thinking to have met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, but failed. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1050/">the Swan</a> at Westminster, and there spent a quarter of an hour with Jane, and thence away home, and my wife coming home by and by (having been at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1066/">her mother&#8217;s</a> to pray her to look out for a mayde for her) by coach into the fields to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5228/">Bow</a>, and so home back in the evening, late home, and after supper to bed, being much out of order for lack of somebody in the room of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">Su</a>. This evening, being weary of my late idle courses, and the little good I shall do <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> or myself in the office, I bound myself to very strict rules till <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2622/">Whitsunday</a> next.</p>

		<p>Up betimes to set my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualling</a> papers in order against <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> comes, which indeed makes me very melancholy, being conscious that I am much to seeke in giving a good answer to his queries about the Victualling business. At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> mighty busy, and brought myself into a pretty plausible condition before Sir W. Coventry come, and did give him a pretty tolerable account of every thing and went with him into the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3221/">Victualling office</a>, where we sat and examined his businesses and state of the victualling of the fleete, which made me in my heart blushe that I could say no more to it than I did or could. But I trust in God I shall never be in that condition again. We parted, and I with pretty good grace, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> troubled more and more with her swollen cheek. So to dinner, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">sister-in-law</a> with us, who I find more and more a witty woman; and then I to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a> about my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> businesses, and with my content passed by all things and persons without so much as desiring any stay or loss of time with them, being by strong vowe obliged on no occasion to stay abroad but my publique offices. So home again, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3331/">Mrs. Ferrers</a> come to see my wife. I staid a little with them, being full of business, and so to the office, where busy till late at night and so weary and a little conscious of my failures to-day, yet proud that the day is over without more observation on Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s part, and so to bed and to sleepe soundly.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning. At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> cheek bad still. After dinner to the office again and thither comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9961/">Mr. Downing</a>, the anchor-smith, who had given me 50 pieces in gold the last month to speake for him to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, for his being smith at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>; but after I had got it granted to him, he finds himself not fit to go on with it, so lets it fall. So has no benefit of my motion. I therefore in honour and conscience took him home the money, and, though much to my grief, did yet willingly and forcibly force him to take it again, the poor man having no mind to have it. However, I made him take it, and away he went, and I glad to have given him so much cause to speake well of me. So to my office again late, and then home to supper to a good <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/374/">lobster</a> with my wife, and then a little to my office again, and so to bed.</p>

Walked back again reading of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9921/">Civill Law Book</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where we did our usual business before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>, and heard the Duke commend <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/">Deane&#8217;s</a> ship <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9944/">&#8220;The Rupert&#8221;</a> before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8187/">&#8220;The Defyance,&#8221;</a> built lately by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2461/">Castle</a>, in hearing of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W.

Thence by water to Westminster, and there looked after my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> order, and so by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierces</a>, thinking to have gone to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales&#8217;s</a>, but she was not ready, so away home and to dinner, and after dinner out by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Lovett&#8217;s</a> to have forwarded what I have doing there, but find him and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9945/">his pretty wife</a> gone to my house to show me something. So away to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, and thence to Pierces, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a>, and I took them to Hales&#8217;s to see our pictures finished, which are very pretty, but I like not hers half so well as I thought at first, it being not so like, nor so well painted as I expected, or as mine and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> are. Thence with them to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1608/">Cornhill</a> to call and choose a chimney-piece for Pierces closett, and so home, where my wife in mighty pain and mightily vexed at my being abroad with these women; and when they were gone called them whores and I know not what, which vexed me, having been so innocent with them. So I with them to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3028/">Mrs. Turner&#8217;s</a> and there sat with them a while, anon my wife sends for me, I come, and what was it but to scold at me and she would go abroad to take the ayre presently, that she would. So I left my company and went with her to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5228/">Bow</a>, but was vexed and spoke not one word to her all the way going nor coming, or being come home, but went up straight to bed. Half an hour after (she in the coach leaning on me as being desirous to be friends) she comes up mighty sicke with a fit of the cholique and in mighty pain and calls for me out of the bed; I rose and held her, she prays me to forgive her, and in mighty pain we put her to bed, where the pain ceased by and by, and so had some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4103/">asparagus</a> to our bed side for supper and very kindly afterward to sleepe and good friends in the morning.</p>

We took with us <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3028/">Mrs. Turner</a>, who was come to visit <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> just as we were going out. A great deale of tittle tattle discourse to little purpose, I finding her, though in other things a very discreete woman, as very a gossip speaking of her neighbours as any body. Going out towards <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7501/">Hackney</a> by coach for the ayre, the silly coachman carries us to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7093/">Shoreditch</a>, which was so pleasant a piece of simplicity in him and us, that made us mighty merry.

He raised many scruples which were to be answered another day and so parted, giving me an alarme how to provide myself against the day of my passing my accounts. Thence I to Westminster to look after the striking of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, but nothing done or to be done therein.

That being in good time done we met at the office and there sat all the morning. At noon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> troubled still at my checking her last night in the coach in her long stories out of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9948/">Grand Cyrus</a>, which she would tell, though nothing to the purpose, nor in any good manner. This she took unkindly, and I think I was to blame indeed; but she do find with reason, that in the company of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Pierce</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9483/">Knipp</a>, or other women that I love, I do not value her, or mind her as I ought. However very good friends by and by, and to dinner, and after dinner up to the putting our dining room in order, which will be clean again anon, but not as it is to be because of the pictures which are not come home.</p>

<p>To the office and did much business, in the evening to Westminster and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> about business and among other things met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/106/">Sir G. Downing</a> on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1489/">White Hall bridge</a>, and there walked half an hour, talking of the success of the late new Act; and indeed it is very much, that that hath stood really in the room of 800,000<i>l.</i> now since <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/314/">Christmas</a>, being itself but 1,250,000<i>l.</i>. And so I do really take it to be a very considerable thing done by him; for the beginning, end, and every part of it, is to be imputed to him.</p>

<p>So home by water, and there hard till 12 at night at work finishing the great letter to the Duke of Yorke against to-morrow morning, and so home to bed.</p>

<p>This day come home again my little girle <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6687/">Susan</a>, her sicknesse proving an ague, and she had a fit soon almost as she come home.</p>

<p>The fleete is not yet gone from the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8827/">Nore</a>. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/301/">The plague</a> encreases in many places, and is 53 this week with us.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where we all met to present a letter to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a>, complaining solemnly of the want of money, and that being done, I to and again up and down Westminster, thinking to have spent a little time with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8177/">Sarah</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1707/">the Swan</a>, or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin</a>, but was disappointed in both, so walked the greatest part of the way <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where comes <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/916/">Mr. Symons</a>, my old acquaintance, to dine with me, and I made myself as good company as I could to him, but he was mighty impertinent methought too yet, and thereby I see the difference between myself now and what it was heretofore, when I reckoned him a very brave fellow.</p>

<p>After dinner he and I walked together as far as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/141/">Cheapside</a>, and I quite through to Westminster again, and fell by chance into <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1171/">St. Margett&#8217;s Church</a>, where I heard a young man play the foole upon the doctrine of purgatory. At this church I spied <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5329/">Betty Howlett</a>, who indeed is mighty pretty, and struck me mightily. After church time, standing in the Church yarde, she spied me, so I went to her, her <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6514/">father</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6513/">mother</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9771/">husband</a> being with her. They desired and I agreed to go home with Mr. Michell, and there had the opportunity to have saluted two or three times Betty and make an acquaintance which they are pleased with, though not so much as I am or they think I am. I staid here an houre or more chatting with them in a little sorry garden of theirs by the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5097/">Bowling Alley</a>, and so left them and I by water home, and there was in great pain in mind lest <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, who is going down to the Fleete, should come to me or send for me to be informed in the state of things, and particularly the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualling</a>, that by my pains he might seem wise. So after spending an houre with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> pleasantly in her closett, I to bed even by daylight.</p>

		<p>Comes betimes a letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a>, that he and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> are ordered presently down to the Fleete. I up and saw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a> gone also after them, and so I finding it a leisure day fell to making cleane my closett in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, which I did to my content and set up my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6261/">Platts</a> again, being much taken also with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/">Griffin&#8217;s</a> mayde, that did cleane it, being a pretty mayde.</p>

<p>I left her at it, and toward Westminster myself with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> by coach and meeting took up <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Mr. Lovett</a> the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13821/">varnisher</a> with us, who is a pleasant speaking and humoured man, so my wife much taken with him, and a good deale of worke I believe I shall procure him.</p>

<p>I left my wife at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a> and myself to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">Exchequer</a>, to looke after my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, and there met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/106/">Sir G. Downing</a>, who shewed me his present practise now begun this day to paste up upon the Exchequer door a note of what orders upon the new Act are paid and now in paying, and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4209/">Lord of Oxford</a> coming by, also took him, and shewed him his whole method of keeping his books, and everything of it, which indeed is very pretty, and at this day there is assigned upon the Act 804,000<i>l.</i>.</p>

<p>Thence at the New Exchange took up my wife again, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and after dinner to my office again to set things in order. In the evening out with my wife and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/995/">aunt Wight</a>, to take the ayre, and happened to have a pleasant race between our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/575/">hackney-coach</a> and a gentleman&#8217;s. At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5228/">Bow</a> we eat and drank and so back again, it being very cool in the evening. Having set home my aunt and come home, I fell to examine my wife&#8217;s kitchen book, and find 20<i>s.</i> mistake, which made me mighty angry and great difference between us, and so in the difference to bed. &#8212;[Sam forgets that he is still out 50<i>l.</i> on his own personal accounts which is about $50,000 (ann. 2001) compared to his wife&#8217;s $1000 D.W.]&#8212;</p>

I walked thither, and come back again by water, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and did our usual business before the Duke, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a>, where the lazy rogues have not yet done my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, which vexes me. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Mr. Hales</a>, and paid him for my picture, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill&#8217;s</a>, for the first 14<i>l.</i> for the picture, and 25<i>s.</i> for the frame, and for the other 7<i>l.</i> for the picture, it being a copy of his only, and 5<i>s.</i> for the frame; in all, 22<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> I am very well satisfied in my pictures, and so took them in another coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> along with me, and there with great pleasure <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I hung them up, and, that being done, to dinner, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8955/">Mrs. Barbara Sheldon</a> come to see us and dined with us, and we kept her all the day with us, I going down to Deptford, and, Lord! to see with what itching desire I did endeavour to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell&#8217;s wife</a>, but failed, for which I am glad, only I observe the folly of my mind that cannot refrain from pleasure at a season above all others in my life requisite for me to shew my utmost care in.</p>

<p>I walked both going and coming, spending my time reading of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9921/">Civill and Ecclesiastical Law book</a>. Being returned home, I took my wife and Mrs. Barbary and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> out by coach and went our Grand Tour, and baited at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2594/">Islington</a>, and so late home about 11 at night, and so with much pleasure to bed.</p>

So to bed.</p>

At noon took <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5132/">Mr. Deane</a> (lately come to towne) <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> with me to dinner, and there after giving him some reprimands and good advice about his deportment in the place where by my interest he is at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, and then declaring my resolution of being his friend still, we did then fall to discourse about his ship <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9944/">&#8220;Rupert,&#8221;</a> built by him there, which succeeds so well as he hath got great honour by it, and I some by recommending him; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke</a>, and every body saying it is the best ship that was ever built. And then he fell to explain to me his manner of casting the draught of water which a ship will draw before-hand: which is a secret the King and all admire in him; and he is the first that hath come to any certainty before-hand, of foretelling the draught of water of a ship before she be launched. I must confess I am much pleased in his successe in this business, and do admire at the confidence of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2461/">Castle</a> who did undervalue the draught Deane sent up to me, that I was ashamed to owne it or him, Castle asking of me upon the first sight of it whether he that laid it down had ever built a ship or no, which made me the more doubtfull of him.</p>

<p>He being gone, I to the office, where much business and many persons to speake with me. Late home and to bed, glad to be at a little quiett.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). With <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a> in the morning. At noon dined mighty nobly, ourselves alone. After dinner my wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a>, to be gossip to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9099/">Mrs. Daniel&#8217;s</a> child. I out to Westminster, and straight to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1157/">Mrs. Martin&#8217;s</a>, and there did what I would with her, she staying at home all the day for me; and not being well pleased with her over free and loose company, I away to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1012/">Westminster Abbey</a>, and there fell in discourse with <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/539/">Mr. Blagrave</a>, whom I find a sober politique man, that gets money and increase of places, and thence by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and thence by water after I had discoursed awhile with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7720/">Mr. Yeabsly</a>, whom I met and took up in my coach with me, and who hath this day presented my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a> with 100<i>l.</i> to bespeak his friendship to him in his accounts now before us; and my Lord hath received it, and so I believe is as bad, as to bribes, as what the world says of him. Calling on all the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualling</a> ships to know what they had of their complements, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, to enquire after a little business there, and thence by water back again, all the way coming and going reading my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6529/">Lord Bacon&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6530/">&#8220;Faber Fortunae,&#8221;</a> which I can never read too often, and so back home, and there find my wife come home, much pleased with the reception she had there, and she was godmother, and did hold the child at the Font, and it is called John.</p>

<p>So back again home, and after setting my papers in order and supping, to bed, desirous to rise betimes in the morning.</p>

		<p>Up between 4 and 5 o&#8217;clock and to set several papers to rights, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we had an extraordinary meeting. But, Lord! how it torments me to find myself so unable to give an account of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualling</a> business, which puts me out of heart in every thing else, so that I never had a greater shame upon me in my owne mind, nor more trouble as to publique business than I have now, but I will get out of it as soon as possibly I can.</p>

<p>At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and after dinner comes in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> brother <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/631/">Balty</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">his wife</a>, he being stepped ashore from the fleete for a day or two.</p>

<p>I away in some haste to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly,</a> where it is stupendous to see how favourably, and yet closely, my Lord Ashly carries himself to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7720/">Mr. Yeabsly</a>, in his business, so as I think we shall do his business for him in very good manner. But it is a most extraordinary thing to observe, and that which I would not but have had the observation of for a great deal of money.</p>

<p>Being done there, and much forwarded Yeabsly&#8217;s business, I with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H. Cholmly</a> to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellassis</a>, who is lately come from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> to visit him, but is not within. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/128/">Westminster Hall</a> a little about business and so home by water, and then out with my wife, her brother, sister, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2594/">Islington</a>, our grand tour, and there eat and drank. But in discourse I am infinitely pleased with Balty, his deportment in his business of Muster-Master, and hope mighty well from him, and am glad with all my heart I put him into this business.</p>

<p>Late home and to bed, they also lying at my house, he intending to go away to-morrow back again to sea.</p>

		<p>Up by 5 o&#8217;clock and to my chamber settling several matters in order. So out toward <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, calling in my way on my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellassis</a>, where I come to his bedside, and did give me a full and long account of his matters, how he left them at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>. Declares himself fully satisfied with my care: seems cunningly to argue for encreasing the number of men there. Told me the whole story of his gains by the Turky <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9633/">prizes</a>, which he owns he hath got about 5000<i>l.</i> by. Promised me the same profits <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a> was to have had; and in fine, I find him a pretty subtle man; and so I left him, and to White Hall before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> and did our usual business, and eased my mind of two or three things of weight that lay upon me about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5848/">Lanyon&#8217;s</a> salary, which I have got to be 150<i>l.</i> per annum. Thence to Westminster to look after getting some little for some great <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, but shall find trouble in it. Thence homeward and met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke</a>, and spoke about this, in which he is scrupulous. After that to talk of the wants of the Navy. He lays all the fault now upon the new Act, and owns his owne folly in thinking once so well of it as to give way to others&#8217; endeavours about it, and is grieved at heart to see what passe things are like to come to. Thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/291/">Excise Office</a> to the Commissioners to get a meeting between them and myself and others about our concernments in the Excise for Tangier, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> awhile, and thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, and find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> at dinner with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/662/">Mr. Cooke</a>, who is going down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/104/">Hinchinbrooke</a>. After dinner Creed and I and wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> out by coach, leaving them at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>, while I to White Hall, and there staid at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> chamber till the Council rose, and then he and I, by agreement this morning, went forth in his coach by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2186/">Tiburne</a>, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/719/">the Parke</a>; discoursing of the state of the Navy as to money, and the state of the Kingdom too, how ill able to raise more: and of our office as to the condition of the officers; he giving me caution as to myself, that there are those that are my enemies as well as his, and by name my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Bruncker</a>, who hath said some odd speeches against me. So that he advises me to stand on my guard; which I shall do, and unless my too-much addiction to pleasure undo me, will be acute enough for any of them. We rode to and again in the Parke a good while, and at last home and set me down at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Crosse</a>, and thence I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierces</a> to take up my wife and Mercer, where I find her new picture by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2206/">Hales</a> do not please her, nor me indeed, it making no show, nor is very like, nor no good painting. Home to supper and to bed, having my right eye sore and full of humour of late, I think, by my late change of my brewer, and having of 8<i>s.</i> beer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">Home</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/239/">Mr. Hunt</a> come to dine with me, but I was prevented dining till 4 o&#8217;clock by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Sir H.

Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a>, who is at the pay of the tickets with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J.

And these doggs are set out every night, and called together in every morning by a man with a home, and they go in very orderly.</p>

So I left them, promising to return and take them out at night, and so to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/291/">Excise Office</a>, where a meeting was appointed of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/848/">Sir Stephen Fox</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9422/">the Cofferer</a>, and myself, to settle the business of our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>, and it was so pretty well against another meeting.</p>

<p>Thence away home to the office and out again to Captain Cocke (<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/340/">Mr. Moore</a> for company walking with me and discoursing and admiring of the learning of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7600/">Dr. Spencer</a>), and there he and I discoursed a little more of our matters, and so home, and (Knipp being gone) took out my wife and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> to take the ayre a little, and so as far as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7501/">Hackney</a> and back again, and then to bed.</p>

Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where I find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Mr. Lovett</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9945/">his wife</a> came to see us.

		<p>(<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">King&#8217;s</a> birth-day and Restauration day). Waked with the ringing of the bells all over the towne; so up before five o&#8217;clock, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where we met, and I all the morning with great trouble upon my spirit to think how I should come off in the afternoon when <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry</a> did go to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3221/">Victualling office</a> to see the state of matters there, and methinks by his doing of it without speaking to me, and only with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, it must be of design to find my negligence. However, at noon I did, upon a small invitation of Sir W. Pen&#8217;s, go and dine with Sir W. Coventry at his office, where great good cheer and many pleasant stories of Sir W. Coventry; but I had no pleasure in them. However, I had last night and this morning made myself a little able to report how matters were, and did readily go with them after dinner to the Victualling office; and there, beyond belief, did acquit myself very well to full content; so that, beyond expectation, I got over this second rub in this business; and if ever I fall on it again, I deserve to be undone.</p>

<p>Being broke up there, I with a merry heart home to my office, and thither <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> comes to me, to tell me, that if I would see the handsomest woman in England, I shall come home presently; and who should it be but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8107/">the pretty lady</a> of our parish, that did heretofore sit on the other side of our church, over against our gallery, that is since married; she with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9995/">Mrs. Anne Jones</a>, one of this parish, that dances finely, and Mrs. &#8230; sister did come to see her this afternoon, and so I home and there find <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> also come to me. So there I spent most of the afternoon with them, and indeed she is a pretty <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1428/">black</a> woman, her name Mrs. Horsely. But, Lord! to see how my nature could not refrain from the temptation; but I must invite them to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6546/">Foxhall</a>, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4898/">Spring Gardens</a>, though I had freshly received minutes of a great deale of extraordinary business. However I could not helpe it, but sent them before with Creed, and I did some of my business; and so after them, and find them there, in an arbour, and had met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/785/">Mrs. Pierce</a>, and some company with her. So here I spent 20<i>s.</i> upon them, and were pretty merry. Among other things, had a fellow that imitated all manner of birds, and doggs, and hogs, with his voice, which was mighty pleasant. Staid here till night: then set Mrs. Pierce in at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a>; and ourselves took coach, and so set Mrs. Horsely home, and then home ourselves, but with great trouble in the streets by bonefires, it being the King&#8217;s birth-day and day of Restauration; but, Lord! to see the difference how many there were on the other side, and so few ours, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/275/">the City</a> side of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/131/">Temple</a>, would make one wonder the difference between the temper of one sort of people and the other: and the difference among all between what they do now, and what it was the night when <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Monk</a> come into the City. Such a night as that I never think to see again, nor think it can be. After I come home I was till one in the morning with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3164/">Captain Cocke</a> drawing up a contract with him intended to be offered to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> to-morrow, which, if it proceeds, he promises me 500<i>l.</i>.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, there to settle some business in order to our waiting on <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> to-day. That done to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;s</a> chamber, where I find the Duke gone out with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> to-day on hunting. So after some discourse with him, I by water to Westminster, and there drew a draught of an order for my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a> to sign for my having some little <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> made me in lieu of two great ones, of 2000<i>l.</i> each, to enable me to pay small sums therewith. I shewed it to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6083/">Sir R. Long</a> and had his approbation, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke&#8217;s</a>, and did give it him to get signed. So home to my office, and there did business. By and by toward noon word is brought me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">my sister</a> are come. I expected them to-day, but not so soon. I to them, and am heartily glad to see them, especially my father, who, poor man, looks very well, and hath rode up this journey on horseback very well, only his eyesight and hearing is very bad. I staid and dined with them, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> being gone by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1780/">Barnet</a>, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1082/">W. Hewer</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, to meet them, and they did come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2885/">Ware</a> way.</p>

<p>After dinner I left them to dress themselves and I abroad by appointment to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a>, who, it is strange to see, how prettily he dissembles his favour to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7720/">Yeabsly&#8217;s</a> business, which none in the world could mistrust only I, that am privy to his being bribed. Thence to White Hall, and there staid till the Council was up, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> expecting a meeting of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Tangier</a> to end Yeabsly&#8217;s business, but we could not procure it. So I to my Lord Treasurer&#8217;s and got my warrant, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Lovett&#8217;s</a>, but find nothing done there. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and did a little business at the office, and so down by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> and back again home late, and having signed some papers and given order in business, home, where my wife is come home, and so to supper with my father, and mighty pleasant we were, and my wife mighty kind to him and Pall, and so after supper to bed, myself being sleepy, and my right eye still very sore, as it has been now about five days or six, which puts me out of tune.</p>

<p>To-night my wife tells me newes has been brought her that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5735/">Balty&#8217;s wife</a> is brought to bed, by some fall or fit, before her time, of a great child but dead. If the woman do well we have no reason to be sorry, because his staying a little longer without a child will be better for him and her.</p>

				<a href="/diary/1666/05/31/">Thursday 31 May 1666</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>Waked very betimes in the morning by extraordinary thunder and rain, which did keep me sleeping and waking till very late, and it being a holiday and my eye very sore, and myself having had very little sleep for a good while till nine o&#8217;clock, and so up, and so saw all my family up, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/154/">my father</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1568/">sister</a>, who is a pretty good-bodied woman, and not over thicke, as I thought she would have been, but full of freckles, and not handsome in face. And so I out by water among the ships, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1814/">Blackewall</a> about business, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to dinner with my father and sister and family, mighty pleasant all of us; and, among other things, with a sparrow that our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> hath brought up now for three weeks, which is so tame that it flies up and down, and upon the table, and eats and pecks, and do everything so pleasantly, that we are mightily pleased with it.</p>

<p>After dinner I to my papers and accounts of this month to sett all straight, it being a publique Fast-day appointed to pray for the good successe of the fleete. But it is a pretty thing to consider how little a matter they make of this keeping of a Fast, that it was not so much as declared time enough to be read in the churches the last Sunday; but ordered by proclamation since: I suppose upon some sudden newes of the Dutch being come out.</p>

<p>To my accounts and settled them clear; but to my grief find myself poorer than I was the last by near 20<i>l.</i>, by reason of my being forced to return 50<i>l.</i> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9961/">Downing</a>, the smith, which he had presented me with. However, I am well contented, finding myself yet to be <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">worth 5,200<i>l.</i></a>.</p>

<p>Having done, to supper with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, and then to finish the writing fair of my accounts, and so to bed.</p>

<p>This day come to town <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3713/">Mr. Homewood</a>, and I took him home in the evening to my chamber, and discoursed with him about my business of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualling</a>, which I have a mind to employ him in, and he is desirous of also, but do very ingenuously declare he understands it not so well as other things, and desires to be informed in the nature of it before he attempts it, which I like well, and so I carried him to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9465/">Mr. Gibson</a> to discourse with him about it, and so home again to my accounts.</p>

<p>Thus ends this month, with my mind oppressed by my defect in my duty of the Victualling, which lies upon me as a burden, till I get myself into a better posture therein, and hinders me and casts down my courage in every thing else that belongs to me, and the jealousy I have of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Sir W. Coventry&#8217;</a>s being displeased with me about it; but I hope in a little time to remedy all.</p>

<p>As to publique business; by late tidings of the French fleete being come to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9997/">Rochelle</a> (how true, though, I know not) our fleete is divided; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a> being gone with about thirty ships to the Westward as is conceived to meet the French, to hinder their coming to join with the Dutch.</p>

<p>My Lord <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> lies in the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1257/">Downes</a> with the rest, and intends presently to sail to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8540/">Gunfleete</a>.</p>
