		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a>, and by his bedside talked a good while. Among other things he do much insist I perceive upon the difficulty of getting of money, and would fain have me to concur in the thinking of some other way of disposing of the place of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8408/">Treasurer</a> to one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8516/">Mr. Bell</a>, but I did seem slight of it, and resolved to try to do the best or to give it up. Thence to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, where I was sorry to find myself to come a little late, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and at noon going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> I met my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Brunkard</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7789/">Sir Robert Murry</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1626/">Deane Wilkins</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8179/">Mr. Hooke</a>, going by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8517/">Colonell Blunts</a> to dinner. So they stopped and took me with them. Landed at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1349/">Tower-wharf</a>, and thence by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a>; and there coaches met us; and to his house, a very stately sight for situation and brave plantations; and among others, a vineyard, the first that ever I did see. No extraordinary dinner, nor any other entertainment good; but only after dinner to the tryall of some experiments about making of coaches easy. And several we tried; but one did prove mighty easy (not here for me to describe, but the whole body of the coach lies upon one long spring), and we all, one after another, rid in it; and it is very fine and likely to take. These experiments were the intent of their coming, and pretty they are. Thence back by coach to Greenwich, and in his pleasure boat to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, and there stopped and in to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1033/">Mr. Evelyn&#8217;s</a>, &#8212;[<a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9046/">Sayes Court</a>, the well-known residence of John Evelyn.]&#8212; which is a most beautiful place; but it being dark and late, I staid not; but Deane Wilkins and Mr. Hooke and I walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>; and noble discourse all day long did please me, and it being late did take them to my house to drink, and did give them some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4140/">sweetmeats</a>, and thence sent them with a lanthorn home, two worthy persons as are in England, I think, or the world. So to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">Lady Batten</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> is tonight, and so after some merry talk home and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all day, where sat late, and then to the office again, and by and by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">my Lady</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I by appointment yesterday (my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> failed us, who ought to have been with us) to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5974/">Rhenish winehouse at the Steelyard</a>, and there eat a couple of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/374/">lobsters</a> and some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4009/">prawns</a>, and pretty merry, especially to see us four together, while my wife and my Lady did never intend ever to be together again after a year&#8217;s distance between one another. Hither by and by come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1347/">Sir Richard Ford</a> and also <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8518/">Mrs. Esther</a>, that lived formerly with my Lady Batten, now well married to a priest, come to see my Lady.</p>

<p>Thence toward evening <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and to my office, where late, and then home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up betimes and walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Ph. Warwicke&#8217;s</a>, where a long time with him in his chamber alone talking of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a> business, and the abuses he puts on the nation by his bad payments to both our vexations, but no hope of remedy for ought I see. Thence to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/215/">Lord Ashly</a> to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee of Tangier</a> for my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5728/">Lord Rutherford&#8217;s</a> accounts, and that done we to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s</a>, where I did receive my Lord&#8217;s warrant to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6083/">Sir R. Long</a> for drawing a warrant for my striking of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a>. So to the Inne again by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7465/">Cripplegate</a>, expecting my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">mother&#8217;s</a> coming to towne, but she is not come this weeke neither, the coach being too full. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and so out to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, and saw a cat killed with the Duke of Florence&#8217;s poyson, and saw it proved that the oyle of tobacco<sup id="fnr1-1665-05-03"><a href="#fn1-1665-05-03">1</a></sup> drawn by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8519/">one of the Society</a> do the same effect, and is judged to be the same thing with the poyson both in colour and smell, and effect. I saw also an abortive child preserved fresh in spirits of salt. Thence parted, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to the Councilchamber about an order touching the Navy (our being empowered to commit seamen or Masters that do not, being hired or pressed, follow their worke), but they could give us none. So a little vexed at that, because I put in the memorial to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a> alone under my own hand, home, and after some time at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> home to bed.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7025/">Lord Chief Justice Hide</a> did die suddenly this week, a day or two ago, of an apoplexy.</p>

One drop of the Florentine &#8216;oglio di tobacco&#8217; being again given to a dog, it proved stupefying and vomitive, as before&#8221; (Birch&#8217;s &#8220;History of the Royal Society,&#8221; vol, ii., pp. 42, 43). <a href="#fnr1-1665-05-03">&#8617;</a></li>

		<p>Up betimes, and by water to Westminster, there to speak the first time with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6083/">Sir Robert Long</a>, to give him my Privy Seal and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer&#8217;s
</a> order for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">Tallys</a>; he received me kindly enough. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> by water, and presently down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1675/">Woolwich</a> and back to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1814/">Blackewall</a>, and there, viewed the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8520/">Breach</a>, in order to a Mast Docke, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a> to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8521/">Globe</a>, where my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Brunkard</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/708/">Commissioner Pett</a> were at dinner, having been at the Breach also, but they find it will be too great charge to make use of it. After dinner to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1033/">Mr. Evelyn&#8217;s</a>; he being abroad, we walked in his garden, and a lovely noble ground he hath indeed. And among other rarities, a hive of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13820/">bees</a>, so as being hived in glass, you may see the bees making their honey and combs mighty pleasantly. Thence home, and I by and by to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a> to see him, who is yet in his chamber not well, and thence by his advice to one <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8522/">Lovett&#8217;s</a>, a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/13821/">varnisher</a>, to see his manner of new varnish, but found not him at home, but <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9945/">his wife</a>, a very beautiful woman, who shewed me much variety of admirable work, and is in order to my having of some papers fitted with his lines for my use for tables and the like. I know not whether I was more pleased with the thing, or that I was shewed it by her, but resolved I am to have some made. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">office</a> late, and then to supper and to bed. <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">My wife</a> tells me that she hears that my poor aunt <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6327/">James</a> hath had her breast cut off here in town, her breast having long been out of order.</p>

<p>This day, after I had suffered my owne hayre to grow long, in order to wearing it, I find the convenience of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/517/">periwiggs</a> is so great, that I have cut off all short again, and will keep to periwiggs.</p>

		<p>Up very betimes, and did much business before I went out with several persons, among others <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2214/">Captain Taylor</a>, who would leave the management of most of his business now he is going to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7985/">Harwich</a>, upon me, and if I can get money by it, which I believe it will, I shall take some of it upon me.</p>

So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and did much business, and then home to dinner, and there find my poor <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">mother</a> come out of the country today in good health, and I am glad to see her, but my business, which I am sorry for, keeps me from paying the respect I ought to her at her first coming, she being grown very weak in her judgement, and doating again in her discourse, through age and some trouble in her family. I left her and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to go abroad to buy something, and then I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>.

		<p>Up betimes, and find myself disappointed in my receiving presently of my 50<i>l.</i> I hoped for sure of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8455/">Mr. Warren</a> upon the benefit of my press warrant, but he promises to make it good. So by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a>, and there up and down through all the offices to strike my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> for 17,500<i>l.</i>, which methinks is so great a testimony of the goodness of God to me, that I, from a mean clerke there, should come to strike tallys myself for that sum, and in the authority that I do now, is a very stupendous mercy to me. I shall have them struck to-morrow. But to see how every little fellow looks after his fees, and to get what he can for everything, is a strange consideration; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> fees that he must pay himself for this 17,500<i>l.</i> coming to above 100<i>l.</i>.</p>

<p>Thence called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1201/">Unthanke&#8217;s</a> to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1085/">New Exchange</a> and elsewhere to buy a lace <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5633/">band</a> for me, but we did not buy, but I find it so necessary to have some handsome clothes that I cannot but lay out some money thereupon.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> and thence to my watchmaker, where he has put <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/715/">it</a> [i.e. the watch] in order, and a good and brave piece it is, and he tells me worth 14<i>l.</i> which is a greater present than I valued it. So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and after dinner comes several people, among others my cozen, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2541/">Thomas Pepys</a>, of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6515/">Hatcham</a>, to receive some money, of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, and there I paid him what was due to him upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2542/">my uncle&#8217;s</a> score, but, contrary to my expectation, did get him to sign and seale to my sale of lands for payment of debts. So that now I reckon myself in better condition by 100<i>l.</i> in my content than I was before, when I was liable to be called to an account and others after me by my uncle Thomas or his children for every foot of land we had sold before. This I reckon a great good fortune in the getting of this done.</p>

<p>He gone, come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8542/">Dr. Twisden</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8543/">Mr. Lawson</a> about settling my security in the paying of the 4000<i>l.</i> ordered to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Sir J. Lawson</a>.</p>

<p>So a little abroad and then home, and late at my office and closet settling this day&#8217;s disordering of my papers, then to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and all day in some little gruntings of pain, as I used to have from winde, arising I think from my fasting so long, and want of exercise, and I think going so hot in clothes, the weather being hot, and the same clothes I wore all winter.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> after <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">office</a>, and received my <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/715/">watch</a> from the watchmaker, and a very fine [one] it is, given me by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8479/">Briggs</a>, the Scrivener.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">Home</a> to dinner, and then I abroad to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/998/">Atturney Generall</a>, about advice upon the Act for Land Carriage, which he desired not to give me before I had received <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> and Council&#8217;s order therein; going home bespoke <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8568/">the King&#8217;s works</a>, will cost me 50<i>s.</i>, I believe. So home and late at my office. But, Lord! to see how much of my old folly and childishnesse hangs upon me still that I cannot forbear carrying my watch in my hand in the coach all this afternoon, and seeing what o&#8217;clock it is one hundred times; and am apt to think with myself, how could I be so long without one; though I remember since, I had one, and found it a trouble, and resolved to carry one no more about me while I lived.</p>

<p>So home to supper and to bed, being troubled at a letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5179/">Mr. Cholmly</a> from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, wherein he do advise me how people are at worke to overthrow our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">Victualling</a> business, by which I shall lose 300<i>l.</i> per annum, I am much obliged to him for this, secret kindnesse, and concerned to repay it him in his own concernments and look after this.</p>

Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1214/">church</a>, it being <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2622/">Whitsunday</a>; my wife very fine in a new yellow bird&#8217;s-eye hood, as the fashion is now. We had a most sorry sermon; so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">my mother</a> having her new suit brought home, which makes her very fine.

A fine seat, but an old-fashioned house; and being not full of people looks desolately. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2470/">Walthamstow</a>, where (failing at the old place) <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W.

I all the afternoon in the coach reading the treasonous <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8262/">book of the Court of King James</a>, printed a great while ago, and worth reading, though ill intended. As soon as I come home, upon a letter from the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, I took boat at about 12 at night, and down <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a> in a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7865/">gally</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a> and I, down to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7662/">the Hope</a> and so up again, sleeping and waking, with great pleasure, my business to call upon every one of&#8230; [Continued <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1665/05/15/">tomorrow</a>.

<p>Thence at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7408/">Langford&#8217;s</a>, where I never was since <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/236/">my brother</a> died there.

Thence with the Duke of Albemarle in his coach to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">Lord Treasurer</a>, and there was before <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> (who ever now calls me by my name) and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor</a>, and many other great Lords, discoursing about insuring of some of the King&#8217;s goods, wherein the King accepted of my motion that we should; and so away, well pleased.</p>

Both captains were tried; Nixon was condemned to be shot but Stanesby was cleared, and Charnock asserts that he was commander the &#8220;Happy Return&#8221; in 1672. <a href="#fnr1-1665-05-18">&#8617;</a></li>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, where the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5243/">Committee for Tangier</a> met, and there, though the case as to the merit of it was most plain and most of the company favourable to our business, yet it was with much ado that I got the business not carried fully against us, but put off to another day, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5520/">Lord Arlington</a> being the great man in it, and I was sorry to be found arguing so greatly against him. The business I believe will in the end be carried against us, and the whole business fall; I must therefore endeavour the most I can to get money another way. It vexed me to see <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> so hot against it, but I cannot much blame him, having never declared to him my being concerned in it.</p>

<p>But that that troubles me most is my Lord Arlington calls to me privately and asks me whether I had ever said to any body that I desired to leave this employment, having not time to look after it. I told him, No, for that the thing being settled it will not require much time to look after it. He told me then he would do me right to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a>, for he had been told so, which I desired him to do, and by and by he called me to him again and asked me whether I had no friend about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>, asking me (I making a stand) whether <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a> was not my friend. I told him I had received many friendships from him. He then advised me to procure that the Duke would in his next letter write to him to continue me in my place and remove any obstruction; which I told him I would, and thanked him.</p>

<p>So parted, vexed at the first and amazed at this business of my Lord Arlington&#8217;s. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/242/">the Exchequer</a>, and there got my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8499/">tallys</a> for 17,500<i>l.</i>, the first payment I ever had out of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/290/">the Exchequer</a>, and at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/12220/">the Legg</a> spent 14<i>s.</i> upon my old acquaintance, some of them the clerks, and away home with my tallys in a coach, fearful every step of having one of them fall out, or snatched from me.</p>

<p>Being come <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, I much troubled out again by coach (for company taking <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> with me), intending to have spoke to my Lord Arlington to have known the bottom of it, but missed him, and afterwards discoursing the thing as a confidant to Sir W. Warren, he did give me several good hints and principles not to do anything suddenly, but consult my pillow upon that and every great thing of my life, before I resolve anything in it. Away back home, and not being fit for business I took <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a> down by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2673/">Greenwich</a> at 8 at night, it being very fine and cool and moonshine afterward. Mighty pleasant passage it was; there eat a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/395/">cake</a> or two, and so home by 10 or 11 at night, and then to bed, my mind not settled what to think.</p>

I tried it and it pleases me, but did not wear it, being I would not go out today to church.

		<p>Up, and down to the ships, which now are hindered from going down to the fleete (to our great sorrow and shame) with their provisions, the wind being against them. So to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, and thence down by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, it being Trinity Monday, and so the day of choosing the Master of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/939/">Trinity House</a> for the next yeare, where, to my great content, I find that, contrary to the practice and design of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a>, to breake the rule and custom of the Company in choosing their Masters by succession, he would have brought in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1766/">Sir W. Rider</a> or <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/619/">Sir W. Pen</a>, over the head of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8569/">Hurleston</a> (who is a knave too besides, I believe), the younger brothers did all oppose it against the elder, and with great heat did carry it for Hurleston, which I know will vex him to the heart.</p>

<p>Thence, the election being over, to church, where an idle sermon from that conceited fellow, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6348/">Dr. Britton</a>, saving that his advice to unity, and laying aside all envy and enmity among them was very apposite.</p>

<p>Thence walked to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>, and so to the Trinity House, and a great dinner, as is usual, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, where busy all the afternoon till late, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to bed, being much troubled in mind for several things, first, for the condition of the fleete for lacke of provisions, the blame this office lies under and the shame that they deserve to have brought upon them for the ships not being gone out of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1832/">the River</a>, and then for my business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> which is not settled, and lastly for fear that I am not observed to have attended the office business of late as much as I ought to do, though there has been nothing but my attendance on Tangier that has occasioned my absence, and that of late not much.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). By water to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/111/">Duke of Albemarle</a>, where I hear that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8547/">Nixon</a> is condemned to be shot to death, for his cowardice, by a Council of War. Went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1042/">chapel</a> and heard a little musique, and there met with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a>, and with him a little while walking, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/504/">Wilkinson&#8217;s</a> for me to drink, being troubled with winde, and at noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke&#8217;s</a> to dinner, where abundance of company come in unexpectedly; and here I saw one pretty piece of household stuff, as the company increaseth, to put a larger leaf upon an oval table. After dinner much good discourse with Sir Philip, who I find, I think, a most pious, good man, and a professor of a philosophical manner of life and principles like <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8585/">Epictetus</a>, whom he cites in many things. Thence to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">Lady Sandwich&#8217;s</a>, where, to my shame, I had not been a great while before. Here, upon my telling her a story of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5344/">Lord Rochester&#8217;s</a> running away on Friday night last with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5343/">Mrs. Mallett</a>, the great beauty and fortune of the North, who had supped at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5036/">Mrs. Stewart</a>, and was going home to her lodgings with her grandfather, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8586/">Lord Haly</a>, by coach; and was at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/138/">Charing Cross</a> seized on by both horse and foot men, and forcibly taken from him, and put into a coach with six horses, and two women provided to receive her, and carried away. Upon immediate pursuit, my Lord of Rochester (for whom <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> had spoke to the lady often, but with no successe) was taken at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6457/">Uxbridge</a>; but the lady is not yet heard of, and the King mighty angry, and the Lord sent to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/167/">the Tower</a>. Hereupon my Lady did confess to me, as a great secret, her being concerned in this story. For if this match breaks between my Lord Rochester and her, then, by the consent of all her friends, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/113/">Lord Hinchingbroke</a> stands fair, and is invited for her. She is worth, and will be at her mother&#8217;s death (who keeps but a little from her), 2500<i>l.</i> per annum. Pray God give a good success to it! But my poor Lady, who is afeard of the sickness, and resolved to be gone into the country, is forced to stay in towne a day or two, or three about it, to see the event of it. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and to see my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a>, where <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I were shown a fine rarity: of fishes kept in a glass of water, that will live so for ever; and finely marked they are, being foreign. &#8212;[Gold-fish introduced from China.]&#8212; So to supper at home and to bed, after many people being with me about business, among others the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6948/">two</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6949/">Bellamys</a> about their old debt due to them from the King for their <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9960/">victualling</a> business, out of which I hope to get some money.</p>

		<p>Lay long, and very busy all the morning, at noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and thence to dinner to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s</a>, to talk upon the business of insuring our goods upon the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7009/">Hambrough</a> [ships]. Here a very fine, neat French dinner, without much cost, we being all alone with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/">my Lady</a> and one of the house with her.</p>

<p>Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> and wrote letters, and then in the evening, by coach, with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/282/">mother</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, our usual tour by coach, and eat at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2641/">the old house</a> at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2594/">Islington</a>; but, Lord! to see how my mother found herself talk upon every object to think of old stories. Here I met with one that tells me that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/735/">Jack Cole</a>, my old schoolefellow, is dead and buried lately of a consumption, who was a great crony of mine.</p>

<p>So back again home, and there to my closet to write letters. Hear to my great trouble that our Hambrough ships,<sup id="fnr1-1665-05-30"><a href="#fn1-1665-05-30">1</a></sup> valued of <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King&#8217;s</a> goods and the merchants&#8217; (though but little of the former) to 200,000<i>l.</i> [are lost]. By and by, about 11 at night, called into the garden by my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6295/">Lady Pen</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2849/">daughter</a>, and there walked with them and my wife till almost twelve, and so in and closed my letters, and home to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and to Westminster, doing business till noon, and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where great the noise and trouble of having our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7009/">Hambrough</a> ships lost; and that very much placed upon <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry&#8217;s</a> forgetting to give notice to them of the going away of our fleete from the coast of Holland. But all without reason, for he did; but the merchants not being ready, staid longer than the time ordered for the convoy to stay, which was ten days. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/507/">Creed</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/340/">Mr. Moore</a> to dinner. Anon we broke up, and Creed and I to discourse about our <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a> matters of money, which vex me. So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1846/">Gresham College</a>, staid a very little while, and away and I home busy, and busy late, at the end of the month, about my month&#8217;s accounts, but by the addition of Tangier it is rendered more intricate, and so (which I have not done these 12 months, nor would willingly have done now) failed of having it done, but I will do it as soon as I can. So weary and sleepy to bed. I endeavoured but missed of seeing <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/989/">Sir Thomas Ingram</a> at Westminster, so went to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7825/">Houseman&#8217;s the Painter</a>, who I intend shall draw <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a>, but he was not within, but I saw several very good pictures.</p>
