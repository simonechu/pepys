		<p>Lay long in bed, which made me, going by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a> by appointment to have attended the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">Duke of Yorke</a> and my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, lose the hopes of my getting something by the hire of a ship to carry men to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>. But, however, according to the order of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> this morning, I did go to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there after great pains did light of a business with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8235/">Mr. Gifford</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/">Hubland</a> [Houblon] for bringing me as much as I hoped for, which I have at large expressed in my stating the case of the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8248/">&#8220;King&#8217;s Fisher,&#8221;</a> which is the ship that I have hired, and got the Duke of Yorke&#8217;s agreement this afternoon after much pains and not eating a bit of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/394/">bread</a> till about 4 o&#8217;clock. Going <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> I put in to an <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1199/">ordinary</a> by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/276/">Temple Barr</a> and there with my boy <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">Tom</a> eat a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/377/">pullet</a>, and thence home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, being still angry with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> for yesterday&#8217;s foolery. After a good while at the office, I with the boy to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">the Sun</a> behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the Exchange</a>, by agreement with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2515/">Mr. Young</a> the flag-maker, and there was met by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7165/">Mr. Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7673/">Andrews</a>, and Mr. Hubland, a pretty serious man. Here two very pretty savoury dishes and good discourse. After supper a song, or three or four (I having to that purpose carried <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8249/">Lawes&#8217;s book</a>), and staying here till 12 o&#8217;clock got the watch to light me home, and in a continued discontent to bed. After being in bed, my people come and say there is a great stinke of burning, but no smoake. We called up <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten&#8217;s</a> people, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1529/">Griffin</a>, and the people at the madhouse, but nothing could be found to give occasion to it. At this trouble we were till past three o&#8217;clock, and then the stinke ceasing, I to sleep, and my people to bed, and lay very long in the morning.</p>

		<p>Then up and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, where till noon and then to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and at the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7944/">Coffee-house</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8235/">Gifford</a>, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8247/">Hubland</a>, the Master of the ship, and I read over and approved a charter-party for carrying goods for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, wherein I hope to get some money. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, my head akeing for want of rest and too much business. So to the office. At night comes, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Povy</a>, and he and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5786/">Mrs. Bland&#8217;s</a> to discourse about my serving her to helpe her to a good passage for Tangier. Here I heard her kinswoman sing 3 or 4 very fine songs and in good manner, and then home and to supper. My cook mayd <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7583/">Jane</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">her mistresse</a> parted, and she went away this day. I vexed to myself, but was resolved to have no more trouble, and so after supper to my office and then to bed.</p>

		</h1>

		

		<p>Up, and walked with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7767/">my boy</a> (whom, because of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife&#8217;s</a> making him idle, I dare not leave at home) walked first to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/161/">Salsbury court</a>, there to excuse my not being at home at dinner to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/121/">Mrs. Turner</a>, who I perceive is vexed, because I do not serve her in something against the great <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8322/">feasting</a> for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1858/">her husband&#8217;s</a> Reading &#8212;[On his appointment as Reader in Law.]&#8212; in helping her to some good penn&#8217;eths, but I care not. She was dressing herself by the fire in her chamber, and there took occasion to show me her leg, which indeed is the finest I ever saw, and she not a little proud of it.</p>

<p>Thence to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>; thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5263/">Mr. Povy&#8217;s</a>, and so up and down at that end of the town about several businesses, it being a brave frosty day and good walking. So back again on foot to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, in my way taking my books from binding from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1539/">my bookseller&#8217;s</a>. My bill for the rebinding of some old books to make them suit with my study, cost me, besides other new books in the same bill, 3<i>l.</i>; but it will be very handsome. At the &#8217;Change did several businesses, and here I hear that newes is come from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/641/">Deale</a>, that the same day my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> sailed thence with the fleete, that evening some Dutch men of warr were seen on the back side of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10017/">the Goodwin</a>, and, by all conjecture, must be seen by my Lord&#8217;s fleete; which, if so, they must engage.</p>

<p>Thence, being invited, to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/911/">uncle Wight&#8217;s</a>, where the Wights all dined; and, among the others, pretty <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5353/">Mrs. Margaret</a>, who indeed is a very pretty lady; and though by my vowe it costs me 12<i>d.</i> a kiss after the first, yet I did adventure upon a couple.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, and among other letters found one from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7583/">Jane</a>, that is newly gone, telling me how her mistresse won&#8217;t pay her her Quarter&#8217;s wages, and withal tells me how her mistress will have the boy sit 3 or 4 hours together in the dark telling of stories, but speaks of nothing but only her indiscretion in undervaluing herself to do it, but I will remedy that, but am vexed she should get some body to write so much because of making it publique. Then took coach and to visit my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">Lady Sandwich</a>, where she discoursed largely to me her opinion of a match, if it could be thought fit by my Lord, for my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/114/">Lady Jemimah</a>, with Sir G. Carteret&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8250/">eldest son</a>; but I doubt he hath yet no settled estate in land. But I will inform myself, and give her my opinion. Then Mrs. Pickering (after private discourse ended, we going into the other room) did, at my Lady&#8217;s command, tell me the manner of a masquerade<sup id="fnr1-1665-02-03"><a href="#fn1-1665-02-03">1</a></sup> before the King and Court the other day. Where six women (my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">Lady Castlemayne</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5781/">Duchesse of Monmouth</a> being two of them) and six men (the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5315/">Duke of Monmouth</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5826/">Lord Arran</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8251/">Monsieur Blanfort</a>, being three of them) in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6370/">vizards</a>, but most rich and antique dresses, did dance admirably and most gloriously. God give us cause to continue the mirthe!</p>

<p>So home, and after awhile at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a> to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Lay long in bed discoursing with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> about her mayds, which by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7583/">Jane&#8217;s</a> going away in discontent and against my opinion do make some trouble between my wife and me. But these are but foolish troubles and so not to be set to heart, yet it do disturb me mightily these things.</p>

<p>To <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">my office</a>, and there all the morning. At noon being invited, I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">the Sun</a> behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, to dinner to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Belasses</a>, where a great deal of discourse with him, and some good, among others at table he told us a very handsome passage of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/624/">the King&#8217;s</a> sending him his message about holding out the town of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8252/">Newarke</a>, of which he was then governor for the King. This message he sent in a sluggbullet, being writ in cypher, and wrapped up in lead and swallowed. So the messenger come to my Lord and told him he had a message from the King, but it was yet in his belly; so they did give him some physique, and out it come. This was a month before the King&#8217;s flying to the Scotts; and therein he told him that at such a day, being the 3d or 6th of May, he should hear of his being come to the Scotts, being assured by the <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5855/">King of France</a> that in coming to them he should be used with all the liberty, honour, and safety, that could be desired. And at the just day he did come to the Scotts.</p>

<p>He told us another odd passage: how the King having newly put out <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1357/">Prince Rupert</a> of his generallshipp, upon some miscarriage at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5271/">Bristoll</a>, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/795/">Sir Richard Willis</a><sup id="fnr1-1665-02-04"><a href="#fn1-1665-02-04">1</a></sup> of his governorship of Newarke, at the entreaty of the gentry of the County, and put in my Lord Bellasses, the great officers of the King&#8217;s army mutinyed, and come in that manner with swords drawn, into the market-place of the towne where the King was; which the King hearing, says, &#8220;I must to horse.&#8221; And there himself personally, when every body expected they should have been opposed, the King come, and cried to the head of the mutineers, which was Prince Rupert, &#8220;Nephew, I command you to be gone.&#8221; So the Prince, in all his fury and discontent, withdrew, and his company scattered, which they say was the greatest piece of mutiny in the world.</p>

<p>Thence after dinner home to my office, and in the evening was sent to by Jane that I would give her her wages. So I sent for my wife to my office, and told her that rather than be talked on I would give her all her wages for this Quarter coming on, though two months is behind, which vexed my wife, and we begun to be angry, but I took myself up and sent her away, but was cruelly vexed in my mind that all my trouble in this world almost should arise from my disorders in my family and the indiscretion of a wife that brings me nothing almost (besides a comely person) but only trouble and discontent.</p>

<p>She gone I late at my business, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>(Lord&#8217;s day). Lay in bed most of the morning, then up and down to my chamber, among my new books, which is now a pleasant sight to me to see my whole study almost of one binding.

So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a> to him, and there I spoke with him, and so to Westminster, did a little business, and then home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where also I did some business, and went off and ended my contract with the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8248/">&#8220;Kingfisher&#8221;</a> I hired for <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, and I hope to get something by it.</p>

So home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>This being one of the coldest days, all say, they ever felt in England; and I this day, under great apprehensions of getting an ague from my putting a suit on that hath lain by without ayring a great while, and I pray God it do not do me hurte.</p>

But it is a most acceptable thing to hear their discourse, and see their experiments; which were this day upon the nature of fire, and how it goes out in a place where the ayre is not free, and sooner out where the ayre is exhausted, which they showed by an engine on purpose. After this being done, they to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8246/">Crowne Taverne</a>, behind <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there my Lord and most of the company to a club supper; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2309/">Sir P.

		<p>Up, and with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes</a> to attend <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a>, and then we back again and rode into the beginning of my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/804/">Lord Chancellor&#8217;s</a> new house, near <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/466/">St. James&#8217;s</a>; which common people have already called <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8303/">Dunkirke-house</a>, from their opinion of his having a good bribe for the selling of that towne. And very noble I believe it will be. Near that is my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/840/">Lord Barkeley</a> beginning <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8304/">another</a> on one side, and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1676/">Sir J.

Thence I to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/293/">House of Lords</a> and spoke with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8186/">Lord Bellasses</a>, and so to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and there did business, and so to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">Sun taverne</a>, haling in the morning had some high words with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/110/">Sir J. Lawson</a> about his sending of some bayled goods to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, wherein the truth is I did not favour him, but being conscious that some of my profits may come out by some words that fell from him, and to be quiet, I have accommodated it. Here we dined merry; but my club and the rest come to 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, which was too much. Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, and there found <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6480/">Bagwell&#8217;s wife</a>, whom I directed to go home, and I would do her business, which was to write a letter to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6479/">her husband&#8217;s</a> advance into a better ship as there should be occasion. Which I did, and by and by did go down by water to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1350/">Deptford</a>, and then down further, and so landed at the lower end of the town, and it being dark &#8216;entrer en la maison de la femme de Bagwell&#8217;, and there had &#8216;sa compagnie&#8217;, though with a great deal of difficulty, &#8216;neanmoins en fin j&#8217;avais ma volont d&#8217;elle&#8217;, and being sated therewith, I walked home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2301/">Redriffe</a>, it being now near nine o&#8217;clock, and there I did drink some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/10924/">strong waters</a> and eat some <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/394/">bread</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1065/">cheese</a>, and so <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>. Where at my office <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> comes and tells me that she hath hired a chamber mayde, one of the prettiest maydes that ever she saw in her life, and that she is really jealous of me for her, but hath ventured to hire her from month to month, but I think she means merrily.

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> (having a mighty pain in my forefinger of my left hand, from a strain that it received last night) in struggling &#8216;avec la femme que je&#8217; mentioned yesterday, where busy till noon, and then <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> being busy in going with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">her woman</a> to a hot-house to bathe herself, after her long being within doors in the dirt, so that she now pretends to a resolution of being hereafter very clean. How long it will hold I can guess. I dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/852/">Sir W. Batten</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">my Lady</a>, they being now a&#8217;days very fond of me.</p>

<p>So to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, and off of the &#8217;Change with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1313/">Mr. Wayth</a> to a <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1044/">cook&#8217;s shop</a>, and there dined again for discourse with him about <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8307/">Hamaccos</a> and the abuse now practised in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4086/">tickets</a>, and more like every day to be. Also of the great profit <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1637/">Mr. Fen</a> makes of his place, he being, though he demands but 5 per cent. of all he pays, and that is easily computed, but very little pleased with any man that gives him no more.</p>

<p>So to the office, and after office my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4135/">Lord Brunkerd</a> carried me to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/125/">Lincolne&#8217;s Inne Fields</a>, and there I with my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/115/">Lady Sandwich</a> (good lady) talking of innocent discourse of good housewifery and husbands for her daughters, and the luxury and looseness of the times and other such things till past 10 o&#8217;clock at night, and so by coach <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>, where a little at my office, and so to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>My Lady tells me how my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/3375/">Lord Castlemayne</a> is coming over from France, and is believed will be made friends with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1062/">his Lady</a> again.</p>

<p>What mad freaks the Mayds of Honour at Court have: that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8308/">Mrs. Jenings</a>, one of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1402/">the Duchesses</a> mayds, the other day dressed herself like an orange wench, and went up and down and cried oranges; till falling down, or by such accident, though in the evening, her fine shoes were discerned, and she put to a great deale of shame.</p>

<p>That such as these tricks being ordinary, and worse among them, thereby few will venture upon them for wives: my Lady Castlemayne will in merriment say that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8309/">her daughter</a> (not above a year old or two) will be the first mayde in the Court that will be married.</p>

<p>This day my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich</a> writ me word from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1257/">the Downes</a>, that he is like to be in towne this week.</p>

		<p>This day, by the blessing of Almighty God, I have lived thirty-two years in the world, and am in the best degree of health at this minute that I have been almost in my life time, and at this time in the best condition of estate that ever I was in &#8212; the Lord make me thankfull.</p>

<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where busy all the morning. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>, where I hear the most horrid and astonishing newes that ever was yet told in my memory, that <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7463/">De Ruyter</a> with his fleete in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6917/">Guinny</a> hath proceeded to the taking of whatever we have, forts, goods, ships, and men, and tied our men back to back, and thrown them all into the sea, even women and children also. This <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8310/">a Swede</a> or Hamburgher is come into the River and tells that he saw the thing done.<sup id="fnr1-1665-02-23"><a href="#fn1-1665-02-23">1</a></sup> But, Lord! to see the consternation all our merchants are in is observable, and with what fury and revenge they discourse of it. But I fear it will like other things in a few days cool among us. But that which I fear most is the reason why he that was so kind to our men at first should afterward, having let them go, be so cruel when he went further. What I fear is that there he was informed (which he was not before) of some of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/930/">Holmes&#8217;s</a> dealings with his countrymen, and so was moved to this fury. God grant it be not so!</p>

<p>But a more dishonourable thing was never suffered by Englishmen, nor a more barbarous done by man, as this by them to us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">Home</a> to dinner, and then to the office, where we sat all the afternoon, and then at night to take my finall leave of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5786/">Mrs. Bland</a>, who sets out to-morrow for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2783/">Tangier</a>, and then I back to my office till past 12, and so home to supper and to bed.</p>

		<p>Up, and to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a>, where all the morning. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>; where just before I come, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8310/">the Swede</a> that had told <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/800/">the Duke</a> so boldly this great lie of the Dutch flinging our men back to back into the sea at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6917/">Guinny</a>, so particularly, and readily, and confidently, was whipt round <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a>: he confessing it a lie, and that he did it in hopes to get something. It is said the judges, upon demand, did give it their opinion that the law would judge him to be whipt, to lose his eares, or to have his nose slit but I do not hear that anything more is to be done to him. They say he is delivered over to the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7626/">Dutch Embassador</a> to do what he pleased with him. But the world do think that there is some design on one side or other, either of the Dutch or French, for it is not likely a fellow would invent such a lie to get money whereas he might have hoped for a better reward by telling something in behalf of us to please us.</p>

<p>Thence to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/470/">the Sun</a> taverne, and there dined with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1748/">Sir W. Warren</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8235/">Mr. Gifford</a>, the merchant: and I hear how <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8311/">Nich. Colborne</a>, that lately lived and got a great estate there, is gone to live like a prince in the country, and that this <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2510/">Wadlow</a>, that did the like at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/908/">the Devil</a> by <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5184/">St. Dunstane&#8217;s</a>, did go into the country, and there spent almost all he had got, and hath now choused this Colborne out of his house, that he might come to his old trade again. But, Lord! to see how full the house is, no room for any company almost to come into it. Thence <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to the office, where dispatched much business; at night late home, and to clean myself with warm water; <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> will have me, because she do herself, and so to bed.</p>

This morning I was much surprized and troubled with a letter from <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5786/">Mrs. Bland</a>, that she is left behind, and much trouble it cost me this day to find out some way to carry her after the ships to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/5849/">Plymouth</a>, but at last I hope I have done it. At noon to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/189/">the &#8217;Change</a> to inquire what wages the Dutch give in their men-of-warr at this day, and I hear for certain they give but twelve <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8319/">guilders</a> at most, which is not full 24<i>s.</i>, a thing I wonder at. At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a> to dinner, and then in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2463/">Sir J. Minnes&#8217;s</a> coach, <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I with him, and also <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/7761/">Mercer</a>, abroad, he and I to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/180/">White Hall</a>, and he would have his coach to wait upon my wife on her visits, it being the first time my wife hath been out of doors (but the other day to bathe her) several weeks.</p>

<p>We to a Committee of the Council to discourse concerning pressing of men; but, Lord! how they meet; never sit down: one comes, now another goes, then comes another; one complaining that nothing is done, another swearing that he hath been there these two hours and nobody come. At last it come to this, my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/887/">Lord Annesly</a>, says he, &#8220;I think we must be forced to get <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/344/">the King</a> to come to every committee; for I do not see that we do any thing at any time but when he is here.&#8221; And I believe he said the truth and very constant he is at the council table on council-days; which his predecessors, it seems, very rarely did; but thus I perceive the greatest affair in the world at this day is likely to be managed by us. But to hear how my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1055/">Lord Barkeley</a> and others of them do cry up the discipline of the late times here, and in the former Dutch warr is strange, wishing with all their hearts that the business of religion were not so severely carried on as to discourage the sober people to come among us, and wishing that the same law and severity were used against drunkennesse as there was then, saying that our evil living will call the hand of God upon us again. Thence to walk alone a good while in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/248/">St. James&#8217;s Parke</a> with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/830/">Mr. Coventry</a>, who I perceive is grown a little melancholy and displeased to see things go as they do so carelessly.</p>

<p>Thence I by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6535/">Ratcliffe</a> highway, to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8286/">the plate-maker&#8217;s</a>, and he has begun my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/112/">Lord Sandwich&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6261/">plate</a> very neatly, and so back again. Coming back I met <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/8320/">Colonell Atkins</a>, who in other discourse did offer to give me a piece to receive of me 20 when he proves the late news of the Dutch, their drowning our men, at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/6917/">Guinny</a>, and the truth is I find the generality of the world to fear that there is something of truth in it, and I do fear it too.</p>

<p>Thence back by coach to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/2200/">Sir Philip Warwicke&#8217;s</a>; and there he did contract with me a kind of friendship and freedom of communication, wherein he assures me to make me understand the whole business of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4111/">the Treasurer&#8217;s</a> business of the Navy, that I shall know as well as <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1018/">Sir G. Carteret</a> what money he hath; and will needs have me come to him sometimes, or he meet me, to discourse of things tending to the serving the King: and I am mighty proud and happy in becoming so known to such a man. And I hope shall pursue it.</p>

<p>Thence back home to <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> a little tired and out of order, and then to supper and to bed.</p>

		<h1>
			
				<a href="/diary/1665/02/28/">Tuesday 28 February 1664/65</a>
			
		</h1>

		

		<p>At <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/483/">the office</a> all the morning. At noon dined at <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1023/">home</a>. After dinner <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/150/">my wife</a> and I to my <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/1572/">Lady Batten&#8217;s</a>, it being the first time my wife hath been there, I think, these two years, but I had a mind in part to take away the strangenesse, and so we did, and all very quiett and kind.</p>

<p>Come home, I to the taking my wife&#8217;s kitchen accounts at the latter end of the month, and there find 7<i>s.</i> wanting, which did occasion a very high falling out between us, I indeed too angrily insisting upon so poor a thing, and did give her very provoking high words, calling her beggar, and reproaching her friends, which she took very stomachfully and reproached me justly with mine; and I confess, being myself, I cannot see what she could have done less. I find she is very cunning, and when she least shews it hath her wit at work; but it is an ill one, though I think not so bad but with good usage I might well bear with it, and the truth is I do find that my being over-solicitous and jealous and forward and ready to reproach her do make her worse. However, I find that now and then a little difference do no hurte, but too much of it will make her know her force too much. We parted after many high words very angry, and I to my office to my month&#8217;s accounts, and find myself <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/9548/">worth 1270<i>l.</i></a>, for which the Lord God be praised!</p>

<p>So at almost 2 o&#8217;clock in the morning I home to supper and to bed.</p>

<p>And so ends this month, with great expectation of the Hollanders coming forth, who are, it seems, very high and rather more ready than we. God give a good issue to it!</p>
